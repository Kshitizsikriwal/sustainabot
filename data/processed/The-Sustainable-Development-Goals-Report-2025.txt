Foreword
Ten years since world leaders embraced the transformative 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, we have not only the opportunity but the 
obligation to take stock of progress, acknowledge shortfalls and act with 
urgency and responsibility.
Since 2015, millions have gained access to essential services. More 
than half the world’s population now benefits from some form of social 
protection, up by 10 percentage points compared to a decade ago. Child 
marriage and maternal and child mortality rates have fallen, and more young 
people, especially girls, complete school. Women now hold 27 per cent of 
parliamentary seats worldwide, up from 22 per cent. Access to electricity 
and clean cooking has expanded. Internet connectivity has increased 
by 70 per cent, opening new horizons. Around the world, young people, 
communities, civil society and local leaders are stepping up their action to 
deliver on the promise of the SDGs.
Despite these important gains, conflicts, climate chaos, geopolitical tensions 
and economic shocks continue to obstruct progress at the pace and scale 
needed to meet the 2030 target.
This year’s Sustainable Development Goals Report finds that only 35 per 
cent of SDG targets are on track or making moderate progress. Nearly half 
are moving too slowly and, alarmingly, 18 per cent are in reverse.
We face a global development emergency.
Over 800 million people are trapped in extreme poverty. Carbon dioxide 
levels are at the highest in over two million years, and 2024 was the hottest 
year on record, surpassing the 1.5°C threshold. Peace and security have 
worsened, with over 120 million people forced from their homes, more than 
double the number in 2015.
Meanwhile, debt servicing costs in low- and middle-income countries 
reached a record $1.4 trillion, squeezing resources needed for sustainable 
development.
This report tells the SDG story in numbers, but it is, above all, a call to action 
– a call for ambitious action in six critical SDG transitions: food systems, 
energy, digital connectivity, education, jobs and social protection, and 
climate and biodiversity.
 
Making these transitions requires massive investment, robust policies and 
urgent acceleration. It also requires removing barriers to the full participation 
of women in economies and public life, ending gender-based violence, 
and ensuring equal access to education, employment and leadership. It 
means tackling poverty and inequality head-on, closing the digital divide 
and ensuring that technology, including artificial intelligence, is harnessed 
inclusively and responsibly.
Building on the momentum of the Pact for the Future, we have vital 
opportunities this year to gather public and private partners together to 
summon the political will and financing required to get the SDGs on track – 
including the Financing for Development Conference, the High-level Political 
Forum, the Second United Nations Food Systems Summit and the Second 
World Summit for Social Development.
The Sustainable Development Goals remain within reach, but only if we act 
decisively and act now. Together, we can still build the sustainable future 
everyone, everywhere, deserves.

Introduction
As we mark a decade since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, we find ourselves at an inflection point in human history. With 
five years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
this report presents both a frank assessment of our current position and a 
compelling case for why the transformative vision of the SDGs remains not 
only relevant, but also critical to our collective future.
A decade of learning: progress amid adversity
Ten years ago, world leaders gathered at the United Nations and made an 
unprecedented commitment – to leave no one behind and to transform 
our world by 2030. What we have learned since then is that sustainable 
development is not a destination, but rather a journey of innovation, 
adaptation and commitment to human dignity.
This report tells a story of remarkable human resilience and ingenuity. We 
have witnessed great achievements that demonstrate what is possible 
when the international community acts with purpose and solidarity. New 
HIV infections have declined by 40 per cent since 2010. Malaria prevention 
efforts have averted 2.2 billion cases and saved 12.7 million lives since 
2000. Since 2015, 110 million more children and youth have entered school, 
with completion rates rising at all levels, and the gender gap in education 
continuing to narrow.
Access to infrastructure has expanded significantly. By 2023, 92 per cent 
of the world’s population had access to electricity, and Internet use had 
grown to 68 per cent in 2024 from 40 per cent in 2015 – connecting millions 
more to opportunities for education, work and participation. In biodiversity 
conservation, thousands of local successes have helped double the 
protection of key ecosystems critical to our planet’s health. 
These victories are not abstract statistics – they represent real lives 
transformed, families lifted from poverty and communities empowered 
to build better and more resilient futures. They validate the fundamental 
premise of the 2030 Agenda: that sustainable development is achievable 
when we combine evidence-based policies with sustained political 
commitment and investment.
Confronting hard truths
However, this report also compels us to confront uncomfortable truths about 
the challenges that persist. Despite notable progress, the pace of change 
remains insufficient to meet our 2030 commitments. One in 12 people still 
experience hunger, and billions lack access to safe drinking water, sanitation 
and hygiene. Persistent inequalities continue to limit human potential, with 
women devoting 2.5 times as many hours per day to unpaid care work as 
men, and persons with disabilities remaining underserved across multiple 
sectors.
The broader context is increasingly complex. Climate change continues 
to accelerate, with temperatures breaking records year after year. Many 
countries face record debt servicing costs, while a staggering $4 trillion 
annual financing gap constrains development progress. 
Strategic pathways forward
The six SDG transitions – addressing food systems, energy access, digital 
transformation, education, jobs and social protection, and climate and 
biodiversity action – are where concentrated effort can drive systemic 
change. These are fundamental shifts in how we organize our economies, 
societies and relationship with the planet.
We also need to ensure that data – the foundation for effective policymaking  
– is timely, inclusive, and actionable. The Medellín Framework for Action 
adopted at the 2024 World Data Forum sets a clear road map for 
transforming data systems. We must now invest in its implementation.
Success requires treating every intergovernmental process as more than a 
diplomatic exercise. The outcomes of our negotiations must be translated 
into integrated national strategies, supported by adequate financing, 
robust data systems and the institutional capacity needed for sustained 
implementation. 
Call for renewed multilateralism
The challenges we face are inherently global and interconnected. No country, 
regardless of its wealth or capacity, can address climate change, pandemic 
preparedness or inequality alone. The 2030 Agenda represents our 
collective recognition that our destinies are intertwined and that sustainable 
development is not a zero-sum game, but a shared endeavour that benefits 
all.
This moment demands what I call “urgent multilateralism”  –  a renewed 
commitment to international cooperation based on evidence, equity, and 
mutual accountability. It means treating the SDGs not as aspirational goals 
but as non-negotiable commitments to current and future generations.
Measure of our success
As we enter the final five years before 2030, we must remember that the 
true measure of our progress is not in global averages or aggregate statistics, 
but rather in how we transform the lives of those who have been left furthest 
behind. Every child who gains access to quality education, every family 
lifted out of poverty and every community protected from climate impacts 
represents what multilateral cooperation can achieve.
The evidence in this report demonstrates that transformation is possible 
when we combine proven strategies with political courage and adequate 
resources. The SDGs remain as vital and achievable as ever, but only when 
we match the ambition of the 2030 Agenda with the urgency and unity this 
decisive moment demands.
The next five years will determine whether we rise to meet this moment or 
fall further behind. Let us use this critical window to recommit, to act and to 
deliver.

Funding data and statistics: the essential infrastructure for development
I. Five years to go: the stark reality of SDG progress
The 2025 progress assessment reveals that the world remains far off track 
from achieving the 2030 Agenda. Of the 169 SDG targets, 139 could be 
assessed using global trend data from the 2015 baseline to the most recent 
year, supplemented by custodian agency analyses. Among these, only 35 per 
cent show adequate progress – 18 per cent are on track and 17 per cent are 
making moderate progress. In contrast, 48 per cent of targets show 
insufficient progress, including 31 per cent with only marginal gains and 17 
per cent with no progress at all. Most concerning, 18 per cent of targets have 
regressed below 2015 baseline levels.1 
Note: Percentages do not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding.

This June 2025 progress assessment incorporates a few new data sets, resulting in slightly different findings from the Secretary-General’s report on progress towards the 
Sustainable Development Goals, which was conducted in April 2025. Due to ongoing data updates and revised methodologies, direct comparisons with previous years’ 
assessments should be made with caution. Percentages do not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding.
This comprehensive assessment underscores the urgent need for intensified 
efforts to put the SDGs on course. A detailed breakdown of progress by 
target is available at the end of this report.
While this report focuses on global trends, the global averages may mask 
meaningful advances in many countries that have made substantial progress 
across several Goals. These national and local successes – driven by sound 
policies, strong institutions and inclusive partnerships – demonstrate that 
accelerated progress is possible and offer valuable pathways for others to 
follow.

Just as electricity powers modern life and clean water sustains public 
health, reliable data infrastructure underpins virtually every aspect of 
sustainable development. From tracking disease outbreaks and monitoring 
climate impacts to measuring poverty reduction and ensuring transparent 
governance, quality data and statistics systems are essential infrastructure 
for the digital age.  
With only five years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) by 2030, progress has been deeply inadequate. This reflects 
not just implementation challenges, but also a fundamental problem in how 
we measure, monitor and respond to global development needs. Tracking 
SDG progress and course-correcting in real time depends entirely on robust 
data infrastructure. Yet statistical systems remain chronically underfunded 
– treated as technical afterthoughts rather than foundational investments. 
Without reliable data, Governments cannot identify problems early, allocate 
resources effectively or demonstrate accountability.
In this section we first present a comprehensive progress assessment, 
revealing the stark reality of where the world stands on achieving the 2030 
Agenda. Second, we show the improvements made in terms of SDG data 
availability while also highlighting critical gaps that persist. Finally, we 
explore the urgent need for building sustainable financing and resilient data 
systems in the face of polycrises, examining how fragile funding mechanisms 
threaten progress and what strategies can strengthen country-led data 
infrastructure for the future.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in strengthening 
data systems to support SDG monitoring. In 2025, a comprehensive review 
of the global indicator framework – endorsed by the Statistical Commission 
– introduced key updates to better reflect today’s challenges, including 
climate change, inequalities and digital transformation. These changes have 
improved the ability of countries to track progress and to develop evidence-
based policies.
When the SDG monitoring framework was first established in 2016, only 
one third of indicators had good data coverage, and 39 per cent lacked 
internationally agreed methodologies. Today, almost 70 per cent have good 
coverage, and all 234 indicators now have well-established methodologies. 
SDG data availability shows encouraging overall progress between 2019 and 
2025 but with persistent gaps in key areas. Goal 3 (Good health and well-
being), Goal 6 (Clean water and sanitation), Goal 7 (Affordable and clean 
energy) and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) demonstrate substantial 
improvements, with Goal 7 achieving the highest trend data coverage at over 
80 per cent. However, Goal 5 (Gender equality), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities 
and communities), Goal 13 (Climate action) and Goal 16 (Peace, justice 
and strong institutions) continue to lag significantly, at below 30 per cent 
of trend data coverage. These disparities highlight critical blind spots in 
monitoring, revealing the priority development areas that require targeted 
investment as 2030 approaches.

III. Building sustainable financing and resilient data systems in the face 
of polycrises
Data funding faces an uncertain future
According to The PARIS21 Partner Report on Support to Statistics 2024, 
between 2015 and 2022, international financial support to data increased 
by about 50 per cent  in real terms from $586 million to $875 million. Such 
support targeted specific projects for data and statistics in low- and middle-
income countries. While the funding from members of the Development 
Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) has remained stagnant over the years, 
contributions from private foundations, multilateral organizations and non-
DAC countries have grown.  
However, this upward trajectory is now under threat. The overall downward 
trend in total official development assistance (ODA) from 2023 to 2025 
raises concern that international support for data and statistics will likely 
face similar declines, threatening the progress of data-driven development. 
This trend is compounded by the fragile financing structure for data, which 
remains heavily dependent on a small group of major funders. In 2022, nine 
funders provided approximately 70 per cent of all financial support for data 
and statistics. The World Bank contributed the largest share (26 per cent), 
followed by the United States of America  (14 per cent) and the Inter-
American Development Bank (10 per cent).

As previous sections show, while data availability for SDG monitoring has 
expanded, significant gaps remain alongside alarming progress shortfalls. 
These challenges are compounded by a critical vulnerability: the fragile 
financial foundation upon which global data systems rest.
Amid ongoing polycrises – including energy and food insecurity, geopolitical 
tensions and climate shocks – the demand for timely, inclusive and 
integrated data has never been greater. Yet, paradoxically, just as these 
data needs intensify, funding for statistical systems faces unprecedented 
uncertainty. Recent disruptions, from the termination of major survey 
programmes to reduced development assistance, expose the risks of 
building data infrastructure on unstable financial ground.
Addressing this financing crisis requires a fundamental shift towards 
efficient, sustainable and strategic approaches that mobilize both domestic 
and international resources while aligning investments with national 
priorities. Strong national ownership and institutional leadership must drive 
this transformation, supported by coordinated international partnerships 
focused on building resilient, country-led data systems.

Funding fragility undermines global SDG monitoring
The fragility of data financing is well-illustrated after the abrupt termination 
of funding from the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) in February 2025, which led to the suspension of the Demographic 
and Health Surveys (DHS). This has exposed the risks faced by data systems 
that depend heavily on external funders, and it now threatens the production 
of critical data needed to monitor progress on multiple SDG indicators.
The significance of this disruption becomes clear when considering that, 
according to a survey of the SDG custodian agencies, data from the DHS 
have been utilized to varying degrees for 39 SDG indicators for global 
reporting since 2015. The suspension of the DHS has had varying impacts 
for different goals. Goal 3 (Good health and well-being) is the most affected, 
with 11 indicators using DHS data, followed by Goal 5 (Gender equality) with 
six indicators and Goal 2 (Zero hunger) with five indicators.

Moreover, the degree of reliance on DHS data differs across these 39 SDG 
indicators, with some drawing a large share of their data points from the 
DHS, making them particularly vulnerable to disruptions in data collection. 
The chart below highlights five SDG indicators that have the greatest 
dependence on DHS data. Since 2015, 70 per cent of the data points on 
contraceptive use (SDG indicator 5.6.1) and experiences of sexual violence 
(SDG 16.2.3) have come from the DHS. It has also provided over 50 per cent 
of the data points on female genital mutilation (SDG 5.3.2), the urban 
population living in slums (SDG 11.1.1) and the population living in households 
with basic services (SDG 1.4.1). The impact is particularly severe for 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries (LDCs).  
A country-led and system-strengthening approach is key for sustainable investment in data
A robust and sustainable financing system for data and statistics must 
move away from funder-driven, project-based models towards country-led, 
system-strengthening approaches. This transition requires Governments to 
increase domestic investment in their data and statistical systems. However, 
many countries – particularly the low- and lower-middle-income ones – 
face significant fiscal constraints, limiting their ability to allocate adequate 
domestic resources. 
According to information collected by the Inter-Secretariat Working Group 
on Household Surveys, which covers 246 household surveys planned in 
65 countries for the 2024–2025 period, over 90 per cent of these surveys 
in low-income countries rely on external sources, compared to around 20 
per cent in middle- and high-income countries. Similarly, an analysis of 39 
national strategies for the development of statistics (NSDSs) with detailed 
budget designations showed that most low- and middle-income countries 
rely on external funders to support their gender-data activities.

Funding data and statistics
Strong national ownership and institutional leadership can drive a resilient data system 
The termination of the DHS programme is just one example of the broader 
vulnerabilities created by fragile funding mechanisms in national data and 
statistics systems. A May 2025 survey of national statistical offices (NSOs) 
revealed that countries heavily reliant on external funding reported being 
significantly affected by funding reductions earlier in the year. In addition 
to the DHS, numerous household surveys and statistical operations were 
adversely affected.
These disruptions highlight the risks of building national data systems highly 
dependent on external funding. Sustainable and resilient national data 
systems require a strong commitment to national ownership. This means 
that countries define their own data priorities that are aligned with national 
development goals and support them through robust institutional capacity.  
Strategic planning instruments play a critical role in helping countries 
establish these priorities. Annual and multi-annual statistical plans, along 
with NSDSs, provide both operational guidance and long-term strategic 
direction. As of 2023, 79 per cent of countries reported using an annual or 
multi-annual statistical plan, and 54 per cent had adopted an NSDS. 
Equally important is the coordination capacity of NSOs, which is key 
to translating these plans into action. Effective coordination enables 
stakeholders across the national data ecosystem to work together under a 
shared governance framework for statistics. However, in 2023, fewer than 
half of the NSOs reported being satisfied with their ability to coordinate with 
partners within the national statistical system. The situation was even more 
challenging in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where only 26 per 
cent of NSOs expressed satisfaction with their coordination capacity. 
Coordination capability of NSOs beyond the national statistical system 
remains limited. While nearly all countries reported working with public 
institutions, only 50 per cent of NSOs partnered with the private sector, 64 
per cent with academia and just 42 per cent with civil society organizations.

International support is critical for helping countries strengthen statistical capacity 
While national ownership is essential in setting and owning the data agenda, 
many countries – particularly low- and lower-middle-income nations – 
continue to face significant technical constraints. These are reflected in 
the priority areas that countries have identified within three key domains: 
statistical operations, internal organizational functioning and key technical 
areas. Within statistical operations the use of administrative data and 
survey programmes emerged as top priorities. When looking at the internal 
functioning of NSOs, investment in information and communications 
technology (ICT) infrastructure and staff training were identified as the most 
pressing needs. On the technical front countries highlighted data quality 
assurance and coordination across the national statistical system as critical 
areas where capacity must be strengthened. 
As countries work to strengthen their statistical capacity, addressing these 
priority areas requires strong and sustained support from the international 
community. This support must be coordinated, predictable and aligned with 
country-defined priorities; meanwhile, it should be anchored in principles 
of mutual accountability, and it should aim for long-term, system-wide 
strengthening.

Building a resilient future requires sustained investment in data infrastructure 
The outlook for financing to support data and statistics is becoming 
increasingly constrained, with threats to critical statistical operations and 
long-term investments in national data systems. This funding shortfall 
comes amid compounding global crises, raising a crucial question: Can 
countries adapt and evolve under pressure as they did during COVID-19?
There are reasons for cautious optimism. In 2022, when most of the world 
just stepped out of the shadow of the pandemic, an assessment was carried 
out in all NSOs about their readiness for the next crisis. Close to 80 per 
cent of countries – 95 per cent of high-income countries and 61 per cent 
of low- and lower-middle-income countries – reported that they were well 
prepared to respond effectively to another major disruption of similar scale. 
This readiness reflects both the progress made and the potential to build 
even stronger data systems if support were sustained and investment 
coordinated.
The Medellín Framework for Action on Data for Sustainable Development, 
endorsed at the 2024 World Data Forum, provides a bold and unifying vision 
for the next phase of bolstering the global data ecosystems to address global 
challenges; it will create impactful solutions through partnerships, innovation 
and capacity development. Additionally, it emphasizes that data must be 
not only available, but also accessible, usable and trusted. The Framework 
also calls for a significant scale-up of predictable, coordinated and long-term 
financing for data – including through both domestic resource mobilization 
and increased international support. 
As the world enters the final stretch towards 2030, meeting increasing data 
demands requires sustained investment in the foundational systems that 
transform information into action. The question is no longer whether we can 
afford to invest in data infrastructure, but whether we can afford to reach 
2030 without it.

No poverty
• 
Extreme poverty persists, affecting 1 in 10 people worldwide. Recent 
crises have stalled progress, with the burden falling heavily on sub-
Saharan Africa and conflict-affected regions. Without a significant 
acceleration in efforts, 8.9 per cent of the global population will still 
be living in extreme poverty by 2030, under the revised international 
poverty line. Similarly, at the current trajectory, only 1 in 5 countries are 
projected to have halved its national poverty  by 2030.
• 
For the first time on record, over half of the world’s population now 
receives at least one form of social protection benefit. Despite this 
milestone, 3.8 billion people remain uncovered.
• 
Governments are spending more on education, health and social 
protection, but emerging market and developing economies continue to 
lag behind advanced economies in allocating resources to these essential 
services.
• 
A world without poverty will require urgent actions to raise social 
protection coverage in developing nations, close spending gaps 
on essential services and target resources to the most vulnerable 
populations.
Revised poverty estimates show more people in extreme poverty, putting the 2030 goal further out of 
reach
The World Bank revised global poverty estimates using updated price 
data and national poverty lines from over 160 countries in June 2025. The 
international poverty line was raised from $2.15 (2017 purchasing power 
parity (PPP)) to $3.00 (2021 PPP). Under the new threshold, 1.5 billion 
people escaped poverty between 1990 and 2022 – compared to 1.3 billion 
under the previous line. However, the update leads to an upward revision 
of extreme poverty.  In 2025, an estimated 808 million people will be 
living in extreme poverty – up from the previous estimate of 677 million 
– representing 9.9 per cent of the world’s population, or 1 in 10 people. 
Eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 appears highly unlikely due to slow 
recovery from COVID-19 impacts, economic instability, climate shocks, and 
sluggish growth in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2025, more than three quarters 
of the global extreme poor will live in sub-Saharan Africa or in fragile and 
conflict-affected countries.
Concerning the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of halving 
national poverty rates by 2030, all regions are projected to see a decline in 
average national poverty rates. However, only one in five countries are on 
track to achieve the target of halving its national poverty rate by 2030.

the new international poverty line, but also due to the inclusion of new survey data. Dotted 
lines are projected data or nowcasts. Working poverty rate has decreased worldwide but persists in vulnerable regions
Worldwide, working poverty has significantly declined over the past 25 
years, but recent trends in most regions suggest a slowdown in progress. 
In 2024, 6.9 per cent of the employed population – more than 240 million 
workers worldwide – lived on less than $2.15 in 2017 PPP per day, down from 
8.4 per cent in 2015. 
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Central and Southern Asia have made 
significant progress, reducing their shares of the working poor by half or 
more since 2015. However, working poverty rates remain persistently high 
in the world’s most vulnerable countries. In 2024, nearly 3 in 10 workers in 
the least developed countries (LDCs) and 2 in 10 in landlocked developing 
countries (LLDCs) lived in extreme poverty. In small island developing States 
(SIDS), the rate rose from 8.9 per cent in 2015 to 9.5 per cent in 2024.

Goal 1 | No poverty
Social protection coverage is on the rise, but billions are still unprotected
For the first time, more than half of the world’s population (52.4 per cent) was 
covered by at least one social protection benefit in 2023, up from 42.8 per cent 
in 2015. Despite this progress, 3.8 billion people remained unprotected. While 
high-income countries are approaching universal coverage (85.9 per cent) 
and upper-middle-income countries (71.2 per cent) have made substantial 
progress, coverage in low-income countries (9.7 per cent) has barely shifted 
since 2015. Gender disparities persist, with the effective coverage of women 
(50.1 per cent) lagging behind that of men (54.6 per cent). 
Investment disparities explain the coverage gaps. Countries spent on average 
19.3 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on social protection in 
2023, but that proportion ranged widely from 24.9 per cent in high-income 
countries to just 2.0 per cent in low-income countries. Guaranteeing basic 
social security floors in low- and middle-income countries requires an 
additional $1.4 trillion annually, or 3.3 per cent of their aggregate GDP in 2024.

Many feel secure in their land rights, but formal documentation remains limited and unequal
Based on data from 85 countries in 2022, two thirds (66 per cent) of the 
population believe they enjoy secure tenure rights to land. However, only 43 
per cent of adults possess official land tenure documents, and just 15 per 
cent of adults in sub-Saharan Africa. This means nearly 1.4 billion adults in 
developing regions are excluded from formal land markets and from access 
to mortgage-based finance, and they lack legal ways to protect their rights 
to land. In 1 in 5 reporting countries, fewer than 1 in 10 adults hold official 
land documentation, with people living in poverty and those in rural areas 
disproportionately affected. Women represent half of those who believe they 
are secure in their land rights and those who feel protected from eviction. 
However, only 24 per cent of women hold legal land documents, accounting 
for just 3 in 10 of all documented landholders. 
Despite these challenges, customary and other informal tenure arrangements 
continue to provide a sense of tenure security, particularly in rural areas. In 27 
countries with data, between 82 and 89 per cent of the population feel secure 
in their land rights, even when access to formal legal documentation remains 
beyond reach.

Governments are spending more on essential 
services, but there is a 20-point gap between 
advanced and developing economies
Data from 100 reporting countries show that in 2023 the proportion of 
total government spending on essential services (education, health and 
social protection) averaged around 46 per cent – 60 per cent in advanced 
economies and 43 per cent in emerging market and developing economies. 
While spending on essential services has trended upward for both economic 
groups over the past two decades, the gap between the two groups remains 
stable at approximately 20 percentage points. The gap is mainly attributed 
to the higher spending for social protection (15 percentage points) and, to a 
lesser extent, health (5 percentage points) in advanced economies.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, government expenditure on social 
protection and health rose while education spending fell – partly due to 
school closures. These shifts were expected to be temporary with pandemic 
effects fading. However, prolonged health issues and disrupted education 
may have lasting impacts on human capital.
Direct transfers benefit the poorest the most, 
while education and health spending vary 
significantly
Pro-poor public social spending is defined as the proportion of government 
spending benefiting the bottom 20 per cent of the income distribution in 
education, health and direct transfers. In the 51 countries for which data 
are available for all three sectors, on average, 26 per cent of government 
spending benefits the bottom 20 per cent of the population in the most 
recent year with data, though this share ranges from 10 to 39 per cent across 
countries. 
Spending patterns differ across sectors. Direct transfers are the most pro-poor 
sector, with 33 per cent of cash and near-cash transfers benefiting the poorest 
quintile of the income distribution. In education, spending is only slightly 
pro-poor, with 22 per cent of funds reaching the poorest 20 per cent. In health, 
spending benefiting the lowest-income quintile varies significantly among 
countries, ranging from 9 to 59 per cent with an average of 19 per cent.

Zero hunger
• 
Global hunger and food insecurity have declined in recent years but 
remain above pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, an estimated 8.2 per cent 
of the global population faced hunger and about 28 per cent – nearly 2.3 
billion people – were moderately or severely food insecure.
• 
Hundreds of millions of children and women are affected by malnutrition, 
and dietary diversity remains inadequate for both women and young 
children. While the share of countries with high food prices declined 
from 60 per cent in 2022 to 50 per cent in 2023, this is still more than 
three times pre-pandemic norms. 
• 
Public agricultural investment is rising, reaching $701 billion in 2023, but 
the agriculture orientation index continues to fall, indicating a disconnect 
between investment and sector importance.
• 
Getting Goal 2 on track requires urgent action to strengthen food 
systems, support small-scale producers, improve services, ensure access 
to nutritious diets and address structural drivers of food price volatility – 
through coordinated financing and multisectoral strategies. In 2025, the 
United Nations Food Systems Summit and the World Health Assembly 
will help to align global efforts with nationally defined priorities.  
Global hunger and food insecurity have declined in recent years, but progress has been uneven
Global hunger showed signs of improvement in 2024, with 8.2 per cent of 
the population undernourished – down from 8.5 per cent in 2023 and 8.7 
per cent in 2022, though still above 2015 levels. An estimated 638–720 
million people faced hunger. Progress was driven by improvements in South 
America, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia, while hunger continued to 
rise in Northern Africa and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2024, 
hunger affected 22.3 per cent of people in sub-Saharan Africa and 11.8 per 
cent in Northern Africa and Western Asia.  
Food insecurity also declined since 2021 but remained well above 2015 
levels. In 2024, 28 per cent of the global population – around 2.3 billion 
people – were moderately or severely food insecure, up from 21.4 per cent 
(1.6 billion) in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa saw the sharpest rise, with over two-
thirds of its population affected, compared to nearly 50 per cent in 2015. In 
Central and Southern Asia and Northern Africa and Western Asia, over one 
third faced moderate or severe food insecurity.

Global progress on child malnutrition is slowing, with signs of reversal
Malnutrition continues to undermine children’s growth, development and 
long-term health. Between 2012 and 2024, the prevalence of stunting (low 
height-for-age) among children under age 5 decreased from 26.4 to 23.2 
per cent. However, recent data indicate a potential reversal of this progress. 
Stunting remains particularly pronounced in low- and lower-middle-income 
countries, where 86.8 per cent of the 150 million stunted children reside. In 
2024, the prevalence of stunting was higher among boys (24.4 per cent) 
than girls (21.9 per cent). Meeting the 2030 target of halving the stunting 
rate will require a sharp acceleration in efforts. 
The global prevalence of being overweight (high weight-for-height) among 
children under age 5 rose marginally from 5.3 to 5.5 per cent between 2012 
and 2024, but this is not statistically significant. The global prevalence of 
wasting (low weight-for-height) declined from 7.4 to 6.6 per cent during this 
period, with notable declines in the number of children experiencing wasting 
in Central and Southern Asia (by 16 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (by 5 
per cent). Still, these two regions account for over 80 per cent of all children 
globally affected by wasting (57.5 per cent in Central and Southern Asia and 
23.8 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa).

Goal 2 | Zero hunger
Anaemia and inadequate diet diversity remain major barriers to global nutrition goals for women and 
children
Anaemia (which impairs birth outcomes, productivity and cognition) globally 
affected 30.7 per cent of women aged 15–49 years in 2023, up from 27.6 per 
cent in 2012. Its prevalence among pregnant women remains steady at 35.5 
per cent, while rates among non-pregnant women slightly increased from 27.1 
to 30.5 per cent between 2012 and 2023. Reaching the 2030 goal of a 50 per 
cent reduction will require faster, cross-sectoral action. 
Minimum dietary diversity (MDD) is essential for the adequate intake of 
vitamins and minerals. Globally, only two thirds (65 per cent) of women aged 
15–49 years attained minimum dietary diversity between 2019 and 2023. 
Sub-Saharan Africa (44 per cent) and Central and Southern Asia (48 per cent) 
had the lowest rates, while Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (84 per cent) and 
Europe and Northern America (79 per cent) had the highest rates. For children 
aged 6–23 months, dietary diversity remains critically low. About 34 per cent 
met the standard between 2016 and 2022, up from 28 per cent between 2009 
and 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa (23 per cent) and Central and Southern Asia (27 
per cent) are particularly affected.

Small-scale food producers typically earn and 
produce less, yet they are essential for agrifood 
resilience
Small-scale food producers are essential for resilient agriculture, food 
security and the fight against hunger, yet they remain highly vulnerable 
within agrifood systems. Their labour productivity is consistently lower than 
that of larger producers, especially in developed countries, where it often 
falls below 25 per cent that of large-scale producers. Income gaps between 
small-scale and larger food producers remain wide. In most countries, small-
scale producers earn less than $1,500 annually (2017 PPP), and in some 
cases, under $500 – often less than half the earnings of larger producers. 
The gender gap varies across countries. In most countries with available 
data, male-headed production units report higher average incomes than 
female-headed units, while in labour productivity, the gap is not so evident. 
Global agricultural investment reaches record 
highs, but the sector remains underfunded 
Global public expenditures on agriculture reached a record high of $701 
billion in 2023, reflecting a 2 per cent average annual growth since 2015. 
However, agriculture accounted for only 1.85 per cent of total government 
spending. The agriculture orientation index (AOI) – government expenditure 
on agriculture relative to the sector’s GDP contribution – fell from 0.50 
in 2015 to 0.43 in 2023. LDCs and LLDCs allocate 4 per cent of total 
government expenditure to agriculture despite the sector generating 
approximately 18 per cent of their GDP. The AOI in LLDCs decreased from 
0.26 in 2015 to 0.19 in 2023, while LDCs showed marginal improvement 
from 0.20 to 0.21 over the same period.  
Meanwhile, aid for agriculture to developing countries fell slightly by 2.5 per 
cent in 2023 after peaking in 2022. But the total volume increased by 43.5 
per cent, from $12.9 billion in 2015 to $18.5 billion in 2023 (constant 2023 
prices). Support to Africa reached a historical peak in 2023, with an increase 
of 3.8 per cent compared to 2022.  
Pressures ease for global food prices, but they remain triple pre-pandemic levels
In 2023, approximately 50 per cent of countries experienced moderately to 
abnormally high food prices; this is a moderate decline from 2022’s record of 
60 per cent, but it is three times the 2015–2019 average of 16 per cent. This 
decrease was largely driven by reductions in shipping costs and in fuel and 
fertilizer prices, particularly during the first half of 2023. 
While most regions experienced price improvements, Eastern and South-
Eastern Asia saw the proportion of countries with high food prices double 
in 2023, returning to 2020 levels. This was fuelled by rising rice prices amid 
weather-related production concerns, stockpiling and trade restrictions. SIDS 
also saw food-price pressures worsen for a second consecutive year in 2023, 
owing to persistent food-price inflation.

Good health  
and well-being
• 
Global health progress is slowing after decades of gains. Between 2000 
and 2019, maternal and child mortality declined significantly; the HIV 
incidence rate fell; and healthy life expectancy increased by over five 
years. However, COVID-19 reversed some of these gains, cutting life 
expectancy by 1.8 years and slowing progress towards nearly all health-
related SDG targets.
• 
Infectious and non-communicable diseases remain major threats. AIDS-
related deaths have halved since 2010, and 54 countries have eliminated 
at least one neglected tropical disease. Meanwhile, malaria cases are 
rising; tuberculosis returned to being probably the world’s leading cause 
of death from a single infectious agent in 2023; and non-communicable 
diseases killed 18 million people under age 70 in 2021. Risk factors 
such as tobacco use, air pollution and poor diet remain insufficiently 
addressed.
• 
Deep inequalities and underresourced systems persist. Despite a 
growing health workforce and expanded services, major inequalities 
persist. Low-income and fragile settings face the highest risks due to 
underfunded systems, service gaps and workforce shortages.
• 
Global health resilience requires bold investment and equity. To meet 
global health targets by 2030, a substantial intensification of efforts is 
needed to address deep-seated inequalities, strengthen primary care, 
build resilient and inclusive health systems, and ensure universal access 
to quality care.
Global maternal deaths fall slightly, but progress stalls in high-burden countries
The global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) dropped from 228 deaths per 
100,000 live births in 2015 to 197 in 2023. Despite progress, an estimated 
260,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth in 2023. The current 
ratio remains nearly triple the SDG target of 70. Meeting this target requires 
an annual reduction rate of 14.8 per cent between now and 2030. 
Critical disparities persist. In 2023, the MMR in low-income countries stood 
at 346, compared to just 10 in high-income countries. Conflict-affected 
countries faced an MMR of 504, while countries experiencing institutional 
and social fragility had a ratio of 368. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa and 
Southern Asia, which together accounted for 87 per cent of global maternal 
deaths in 2023, have seen limited progress in reducing maternal mortality 
since 2015.
While the global proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel 
increased from 80 to 87 per cent between 2015 and 2024, some 17 million 
births still occurred without skilled assistance in 2024. Regional disparities 
remain stark: in sub-Saharan Africa coverage reached only 73 per cent, 
compared to 97 per cent in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia.
Under-5 mortality rate reveals significant gaps among the regions
Global under-5 mortality fell to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023, 
a 16 per cent reduction from 44 in 2015. Neonatal mortality dropped 12 
per cent from 20 to 17 deaths per 1,000 live births. However, 4.8 million 
children under age 5 still died in 2023, down from 6.2 million deaths in 2015. 
Regional disparities remain stark: sub-Saharan Africa’s under-5 mortality 
rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births is 18 times higher than Australia and 
New Zealand’s rate. Progress has slowed down. The global annual rates 
of reduction for under-5 and neonatal mortality were 3.7 and 3 per cent, 
respectively, during the 2000–2015 period. However, these rates dropped to 
2.2 and 1.6 per cent, respectively, for 2015–2023.  
As of 2023, 133 countries had already met the SDG target for under-5 
mortality, and 7 more are expected to do so by 2030. However, 60 
countries – nearly three quarters of them in sub-Saharan Africa – must 
accelerate progress to meet the 2030 target for under-5 mortality. For 
neonatal mortality, 125 countries have met the SDG target and 10 more are 
expected to do so by 2030, but 65 countries need faster reductions. Current 
trends project 30 million under-5 deaths by 2030. Meeting SDG targets

Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
The global fight against infectious diseases shows critical gains, though global targets remain out of reach 
HIV/AIDs: Expanded HIV treatment access has reduced AIDS-related deaths, 
from 1.4 million in 2010 to 630,000 in 2024. New HIV infections in 2024 
reached their lowest level since the late 1980s – 40 per cent lower than in 
2010, with sub-Saharan Africa seeing a 56 per cent reduction. However, an 
estimated 1.3 million people still contracted HIV in 2024. Concerningly, three 
regions, Latin America and the Caribbean , Oceania (excluding Australia and 
New Zealand) and Northern Africa and Western Asia, experienced rising 
numbers of new HIV infections since 2010.
Of the estimated 40.8 million people living with HIV in 2024, 9.2 million were 
not receiving life-saving treatment – resulting in one AIDS-related death every 
minute. HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women remains 
exceptionally high in sub-Saharan Africa. Vertical transmission is declining 
more slowly, with an estimated 120,000 children acquiring HIV in 2024; this 
brings the total number of children living with HIV to 1.4 million, with 86 per 
cent in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Around the world, funding is shrinking. As of December 2024, over 20 
million people – 560,000 of them children – were receiving antiretroviral 
treatment through the support of the United States of America. In January 
2025, the United States Government paused foreign assistance, which 
disrupted life-saving HIV services for millions across 55 countries, primarily 
in Africa. A permanent halt could result in 6 million new HIV infections and 4 
million AIDS-related deaths by 2029. Domestic and donor financing remains 
insufficient to replace this support quickly, putting service continuity at risk. 
Despite the abrupt cuts, countries such as Botswana, Kenya and Nigeria have 
pledged to maintain services using domestic resources. Global solidarity 
remains essential to protect progress and save lives.
Tuberculosis (TB): In 2023, an estimated 10.8 million people developed TB, 
a slight rise from 2022 – mainly attributed to population growth. However, 
the increase in new TB cases since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
slowed and stabilized. The burden of TB remains heavily concentrated, with 87 
per cent of global cases in 30 high-burden countries. Men represented 55 per 
cent of these cases. 
Encouragingly, TB-related deaths decreased to 1.25 million in 2023, falling 
below pre-pandemic levels and continuing the downward trend started in 
2022. However, TB is likely once again the leading cause of death from a single 
infectious agent, surpassing COVID-19. The global TB incidence rate in 2023 
was 134 per 100,000 population. Between 2015 and 2023, the incidence rate 
had reduced by only 8.3 per cent, falling short of the target set by the End TB 
Strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO), which aims for an 80 
per cent reduction by 2030. African and European regions showed the most 
progress, with declines of 24 and 27 per cent, respectively.
Malaria: Global malaria response efforts have averted an estimated 2.2 billion 
cases and 12.7 million deaths worldwide since 2000. By the end of 2024, 44 
countries and one territory had been certified malaria-free, and many others 
were advancing towards eradication.
Despite progress, malaria persists as a grave global health challenge. There 
were an estimated 263 million malaria cases in 2023, an increase from 226 
million in 2015. The global malaria incidence rate also rose to 60.4 cases 
per 1,000 population at risk in 2023, compared to 58 in 2015. The 2023 rate 
was nearly three times the target of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for 
Malaria. 
Too many people at high risk still lack access to essential malaria services. In 
2023, more than 40 per cent of children under age 5 and pregnant women in 
sub-Saharan Africa were not protected by insecticide-treated nets. Only 44 
per cent of pregnant women in Africa received the recommended three-dose 
regimen of preventive malaria therapy. 
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs): The number of people requiring 
interventions for NTDs fell to 1.495 billion in 2023, a significant decrease 
from 2.19 billion in 2010 and approximately 122 million fewer than in 2022. 
This progress is reflected in the 54 countries that had eliminated at least one 
NTD by the end of 2024. Despite a 32 per cent global reduction in people 
needing interventions since 2010, this pace is currently insufficient to meet 
the 2030 target of a 90 per cent reduction. In LDCs the proportion of the 
population needing care for NTDs dropped substantially from 79 per cent 
in 2010 to 43 per cent in 2023. However, 493 million people in LDCs still 
required treatment and care for NTDs in 2023.

Non-communicable diseases cause more than half the deaths for people under age 70
In 2021, an estimated 18 million people under the age of 70 died from non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) globally – accounting for more than half of 
all premature deaths. The risk of dying prematurely between ages 30 and 70 
from one of the four main NCDs (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or 
chronic respiratory disease) declined from 22.5 per cent in 2000 to 18.4 per 
cent in 2015 and 18.0 per cent in 2019. However, progress plateaued during 
2020–2021 in countries with reliable data. If pre-2019 trends resume, the 
risk of premature death is projected to fall to 16.3 per cent by 2030. However, 
neither the world nor its regions are on track to meet the SDG target of 
reducing premature NCD mortality by one third by 2030. Women face a lower 
risk of premature death from NCDs than men. In 2019, a 30-year-old man had 
a 21.6 per cent chance of dying from one of the four main NCDs before age 70, 
compared to the 14.4 per cent for women.

Global tobacco and alcohol use is declining, but still cause immense health, economic and 
environmental burdens
Over the past two decades, global prevalence of tobacco use has fallen by 
one third, with an estimated 118 million fewer tobacco users today than 
in 2005. Despite this progress, an estimated 1.25 billion people still use 
tobacco globally, and tobacco use remains one of the main preventable risk 
factors for NCDs. Only 56 countries were on track to meet the target of a 30 
per cent reduction in prevalence between 2010 and 2025 set by the WHO 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable 
Diseases.
Beyond severe health consequences, tobacco use imposes substantial 
economic burdens. The economic cost of smoking, from health expenditures 
and productivity losses, was estimated at 1.8 per cent of the world’s annual 
GDP in 2012. Roughly 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are discarded every year 
into our environment – the second highest form of plastic pollution. Valuable 
agricultural land and water are wasted on growing tobacco instead of food. 
Production and consumption of tobacco releases 80 million tons of carbon 
dioxide into the air every year.
Global alcohol consumption per capita (ages 15 and older) fell by 12 per cent 
from 5.7 litres of pure alcohol in 2010 to 5.0 litres in 2022. Globally, fewer 
women consume alcohol than men, and when they do, they tend to drink 
less. In 2019, 56 per cent of the world’s population aged 15 years or older 
(65 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men) abstained from drinking 
alcohol in the past 12 months. Despite some promising global trends in the 
prevalence of heavy episodic drinking and the number of age-standardized, 
alcohol-attributable deaths between 2010 and 2019, the overall burden of 
disease and injuries caused by the harmful use of alcohol is high, particularly 
in Africa and Europe.
Falling global suicide rate contrasts sharply with upward trends in some regions
Worldwide, an estimated 727,000 people died by suicide in 2021. While 
the global crude suicide rate showed progress, falling from 12.5 to 9.2 per 
100,000 population between 2000 and 2021, this improvement was not 
universal. Significant decreases were observed in regions such as Central 
Asia (down 51 per cent), Europe (down 40 per cent) and Eastern Asia 
(down 37 per cent). However, during the same period, the crude suicide rate 
markedly increased in Northern America (up 33 per cent), Latin America 
and the Caribbean (up 25 per cent) and South-Eastern Asia (up 10 per 
cent). In 2021, the majority of suicides were found in low- and middle-
income countries (73 per cent). Suicide prevention requires strong political 
commitment and coordinated action. WHO’s LIVE LIFE Initiative for Suicide 
Prevention promotes four key interventions: limiting access to means, 
encouraging responsible media reporting, building adolescents’ life skills and 
ensuring early support for those at risk.

Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
More women use modern methods of contraception, and fewer adolescents give birth 
The proportion of women of reproductive age (15–49 years) having their need 
for family planning satisfied with modern methods stands at 77.2 per cent in 
2025, a slight increase from 76.4 per cent in 2015. Most regions have seen 
improvements, with sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the largest rise – from 
51.6 to 57.9 per cent. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia remains the highest at 
over 86 per cent in 2025, though it is the only region to see a slight decline. 
Substantial global progress has been made in reducing adolescent birth rates. 
Among girls aged 15–19 years, the global birth rate fell from 45.9 births per 
1,000 in 2015 to 38.3 in 2024. For girls aged 10–14 years, the rate dropped 
from 1.5 per 1,000 in 2015 to 1.0 in 2024. Consequently, births to adolescent 
mothers decreased from 13.9 million in 2015 to 12.4 million in 2024. In Central 
and Southern Asia, the adolescent birth rate (ages 15–19 years) plummeted 
from 106 per 1,000 in 2000 to 25.1 in 2024. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa, 
while experiencing some decline, continues to report the highest rates globally: 
92.9 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 years and 3.1 births per 1,000 girls 
aged 10–14 years in 2024.

Vaccine delivery systems have not fully rebounded post-pandemic, making global targets unlikely
Between 2020 and 2022, global childhood immunization programmes 
experienced significant setbacks, with stagnation or dips in coverage for all 
four tracked childhood vaccines. In 2023, coverage for the third dose of the 
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine – often used as a marker of 
a well-functioning routine immunization system – reached 84 per cent. That 
is still below pre-pandemic levels, indicating substantial residual dysfunction 
in global vaccine delivery systems. 
While the other three tracked vaccines saw some increases in coverage, 
those were partly due to new national introductions rather than restored 
service levels. Global coverage for the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine 
among girls aged 9–14 years remains very low, with huge variations between 
countries. This leaves millions of girls worldwide susceptible to cervical 
cancer later in life. Measles outbreaks have surged in many countries due to 
inadequate coverage of the second dose of the measles vaccine (MCV2). If 
current trends continue, the global target of 90 per cent set by Immunization 
Agenda 2030 is unlikely to be met for any of these vaccinations. 
Official development assistance for health sees sharp decline from pandemic peak, but remains above 
pre-pandemic levels
Gross official development assistance (ODA) for medical research and basic 
health totalled $13.4 billion in 2023, a 39 per cent decrease from the historic 
peak in 2022 of $22.1 billion (in constant 2023 prices), which was driven 
primarily by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this post-
pandemic reduction, ODA for medical research and basic health in 2023 
was still 22.5 per cent higher than 2015 levels and slightly above 2019 levels. 
In 2023, $3.7 billion were spent for infectious disease control (excluding 
malaria, tuberculosis, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted 
diseases); in addition, $2.4 billion went towards malaria control and $2.2 
billion towards basic healthcare. Funding for COVID-19 control decreased by 
78 per cent from 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2023. In 2023, LDCs received 40 per 
cent of the total ODA for medical research and basic health or $5.5 billion, a 
20 per cent decrease from 2022.

Despite a growing health workforce, a global shortage persists and is growing as the population 
expands and ages
In 2023, the global health workforce was estimated at over 70 million, with 
52 million in the five key occupations (dentists, medical doctors, midwifery 
personnel, nursing personnel and pharmacists). A global shortage of 14.7 
million health workers persisted in 2023, down from 15.4 million in 2020. 
The shortfall is projected to decline gradually to 11.1 million by 2030, with 
over half concentrated in Northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.
While the global density of the five key occupations rose by 26 per cent 
between 2013 and 2023, vast inequities remain: high-income countries 
average one health worker for every 64 people, compared to one for every 
621 people in low-income countries. High- and upper-middle-income 
countries, which account for 53 per cent of the global population, employ 80 
per cent of workers in these five key professions and consequently have the 
highest densities. But these countries will still need to recruit an estimated 
8.4 million additional health workers by 2030 to sustain current levels and 
meet the growing demand driven by population growth and ageing.

Quality education
• 
 Education is vital for sustainable development, yet progress remains 
off track. While enrolment and completion rates have improved since 
2015, with girls outperforming boys in most regions, progress is slowing.  
Meanwhile, 272 million children and youth remained out of school in 
2023. 
• 
Learning outcomes are declining in many countries.  Although literacy 
has improved modestly, hundreds of millions of people remain illiterate, 
with women disproportionately affected. Deep inequalities persist due to 
gender, wealth and geography.
• 
 To accelerate Goal 4, countries must prioritize inclusive policies and 
financing that simultaneously address access, learning and equity. 
This includes scaling up quality early childhood education, enforcing 
legal guarantees for free and compulsory education, closing digital and 
infrastructure gaps – especially in LDCs – and expanding lifelong learning 
opportunities for adults and marginalized populations. 
Most countries are off track to meet education targets for access, completion and learning outcomes
Since 2015, 109 million more children and youth have entered school, 
with completion rates rising for all levels. Global completion rates in 2024 
reached 88, 78 and 60 per cent for primary, lower secondary and upper 
secondary education, respectively – up from 85, 74 and 53 per cent in 2015, 
respectively. Girls now exceed boys by 2–3 percentage points at all levels.
However, progress has decelerated. Upper secondary completion rate 
slowed from 1.3 percentage points annually (2010–2015) to 0.8 percentage 
points (2015–2024). Meanwhile, the out-of-school population increased 
by 3 per cent since 2015, leaving 272 million children and youth still out 
of school worldwide. Disparities remain stark: 36 per cent of school-aged 
children and youth in low-income countries are out of school, compared to 
only 3 per cent in high-income countries, and over half of them live in sub-
Saharan Africa. 
Learning quality remains a major concern. Globally, the minimum proficiency 
of primary students stands at just 58 per cent in reading and 44 per cent in 
mathematics in 2019. Among 81 upper-middle- and high-income countries 
with data, the percentage of students achieving minimum proficiency at the 
end of lower secondary education declined between 2018 and 2022 – by 15 
percentage points in mathematics and by 10 percentage points in reading.

Internet use is common in higher-income countries, but many lack basic digital skills 
Information and communications technology (ICT) skills are essential for 
economic and social well-being. ICT skill level is assessed based on recently 
performed tasks that reflect digital proficiency in five areas: information and 
data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, 
safety, and problem solving. Data from 40 countries – mostly high- and 
upper-middle-income – show communication and collaboration as the 
most common digital skills (83 per cent of Internet users have at least 
basic proficiency), followed by information and data literacy (76 per cent), 
problem solving (70 per cent), content creation (60 per cent) and safety (57 
per cent). Despite a high median rate for Internet usage (90 per cent), many 
lack essential skills, highlighting a significant gap between access and the 
ability to use the Internet effectively and safely.

Goal 4 | Quality education
Progress in early childhood education is limited 
and uneven across regions 
Data from 84 countries (2015–2024) reveal that two thirds of children aged 
24–59 months are developmentally on track, with no gender differences. 
However, regional disparities are stark: sub-Saharan Africa has only 54 per cent 
on track while Central Asia and South-Eastern Asia have 83 per cent on track.
Early childhood education participation has shown mixed progress. While 
enrolment for children under age 3 has increased notably in Africa over the 
past decade, participation in organized learning one year before primary school 
has remained stagnant globally, at around 75 per cent since 2015. Sub-Saharan 
Africa (48.6 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (51.4 per cent) 
continue to lag behind. Only about one third of countries have made pre-
primary education compulsory, and only half provide legal provisions for at 
least one year of free pre-primary education. Without such legal guarantees, 
pre-primary education often remains financially inaccessible to low-income 
families, especially in regions dominated by private education. 
Youth dominate educational participation while 
adult engagement remains low
Organized learning encompasses both formal education and non-formal 
programmes, such as adult literacy and work-based training. In 2024, 
globally, one in six individuals aged 15–64 had recently participated in 
education or training programmes; however, participation was mainly among 
youth. Worldwide over half of the young people aged 15–24 engaged in 
learning activities, with rates ranging from 45 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa 
to 64 per cent in Europe and Northern America. In contrast, participation 
drops sharply among older adults; for ages 25–54 and 55–64 years, only 3 
and 1 per cent of adults, respectively, engaged in learning.
Youth participation has risen by over 10 percentage points since 2000, with 
Central and Southern Asia nearly doubling its rate. However, progress has 
slowed since 2015, with less than three percentage points gained globally. 
Adult participation rates have remained stagnant since 2000. Among youth, 
females tend to have lower participation rates than males, with a two-
percentage-point disparity persisting at the global level.
Steady progress in global literacy, but regional disparities persist
Globally, literacy rates have improved over the past two decades, with 
increases in reading and writing skills and with reduced gender disparities. 
Despite this, 754 million adults remained illiterate in 2024, with women 
accounting for 63 per cent of the total. 
Youth literacy rose from 91 per cent in 2014 to 93 per cent in 2024, with 
notable gains in Central and Southern Asia (from 87 to 94 per cent) and 
sub-Saharan Africa (from 75 to 79 per cent), while Oceania (excluding 
Australia and New Zealand) saw little change at 73 per cent. 
Adult literacy increased globally from 85 to 88 per cent over the same 
period, led by Central and Southern Asia (from 70 to 77 per cent). However, 
the rates remained low in Oceania (67 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa 
(69 per cent). Europe and Northern America continue to lead, with a youth 
literacy rate of 99 per cent and an adult literacy rate exceeding 98 per cent.

Gender disparities in education persist
Socioeconomic disparities are evident within many education indicators. 
However, parity ratios at the global and regional levels can mask inequalities 
within countries. Gender disparities remain widespread. In 2024, 4 in 10 
countries with data lack gender parity at primary completion; this rises to 
over half the countries at lower secondary completion and to 5 in 6 at upper 
secondary. For tertiary education, only 1 in 20 countries with recent data 
reach gender parity in gross enrolment.
In countries with disparities, boys are more likely to be out of school, less 
likely to complete schooling and underrepresented in tertiary education. 
Yet, significant disadvantages for girls persist in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Learning outcomes show mixed patterns; disparities in math proficiency 
exist for both genders, while reading gaps consistently had boys at a 
disadvantage at the end of lower secondary school.
Location and wealth create even larger gaps, with 60 per cent of countries 
with recent data showing rural-urban inequalities at lower secondary 
completion and over 90 per cent of countries showing wealth disparities. 
The intersection of gender, geography and economic status creates 
multilayered barriers requiring targeted interventions addressing both access 
and quality across education systems.
Basic school infrastructure improves globally 
while it lags in LDCs
Adequate school infrastructure is essential for safe and effective learning. 
Between 2015 and 2023, electricity access in primary schools increased 
globally by over 10 percentage points, mainly driven by rapid expansion in 
Central and Southern Asia. Internet access within schools has increased 
notably since the COVID-19 pandemic, and provision of drinking water in the 
primary schools of sub-Saharan Africa has improved by 10 percentage points 
since 2016.
Despite this progress, significant gaps remain. Globally, over 20 per cent 
of primary schools lack access to electricity, drinking water or sanitation. 
Fewer than half have computers, Internet or disability-adapted facilities. The 
situation is worse in LDCs, where over a third of primary schools lack basic 
sanitation, more than half lack electricity and over two thirds lack digital 
tools; only one in five offer disability-friendly infrastructure.

Gender equality
• 
Three decades after the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform 
for Action, gender equality remains elusive.  Despite progress, 
discriminatory laws and gender-based norms continue to hinder gender 
equality. Women remain underrepresented in decision-making and 
leadership roles and often lack autonomy over sexual and reproductive 
health, land rights and technology access. Women’s disproportionate 
share of unpaid domestic and care work continues to limit their access to 
education, career opportunities and political engagement, while harmful 
practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), 
persist globally.
• 
Well-designed public finance systems are essential for financing gender 
equality commitments. However, only 26 per cent of 121 countries 
and areas have comprehensive systems to track resource allocations 
for gender equality – unchanged since 2021 – highlighting persistent 
capacity gaps in accurately costing, allocating and spending resources to 
implement national gender equality laws and policies.
• 
Achieving gender equality requires integrated, comprehensive and 
gender-responsive policy packages that strengthen legal frameworks, 
reduce economic and structural barriers and scale up investment in 
gender equality at all levels. 
Continuing legal reforms show progress, but gaps 
remain in all areas
Significant progress in advancing women’s rights has been recorded globally, 
with 99 positive legal reforms implemented between 2019 and 2024 to remove 
discriminatory laws and establish gender equality frameworks. Most reforms 
targeted employment and economic benefits, including lifting work restrictions, 
guaranteeing equal pay and providing maternity leave, as well as strengthening 
protections against domestic violence.
Despite this progress, data from 131 countries in 2024 reveal substantial 
challenges remain. No country achieves a perfect score across all four 
areas measured: legal frameworks and public life, violence against women, 
employment and economic benefit, and marriage and family. Over half of the 
countries (51 per cent) have gaps in each area. Critical restrictions persist: 61 
countries (47 per cent) maintain at least one restriction preventing women 
from performing the same jobs as men. Only 38 countries (29 per cent) 
establish 18 years as the minimum marriage age without exceptions, and just 
63 countries (48 per cent) have rape laws based on lack of consent.     
Despite progress in certain countries, child 
marriage and female genital mutilation remain a 
reality
Today, nearly one in five young women aged 20–24 (19 per cent) were first 
married or in a union before age 18. While child marriage has become less 
common globally, largely due to progress in Southern Asia, levels remain 
highest in sub-Saharan Africa (31 per cent). Unlike the global trend, its 
growing share of the world’s child brides is projected to see an increase in 
absolute numbers by 2030, driven by slow progress and rapid population 
growth.
Globally, over 230 million girls and women have undergone FGM. Africa 
accounts for more than 144 million cases, followed by Asia with over 80 
million and the Middle East with 6 million. Each year, 4 million girls undergo 
FGM, with over 2 million before age 5. Despite progress in countries such as 
Benin, Burkina Faso, Kenya and Sierra Leone, eliminating FGM by 2030 will 
require accelerating progress to 27 times the pace of the past decade. 
Gender inequality in land ownership and weak legal protection are persistent barriers to women’s 
empowerment
Secure land rights are vital for empowering rural women and strengthening 
agrifood systems. Women with secure tenure are more likely to invest, 
innovate, boost productivity and lift their families out of poverty. A 
global review of 84 countries shows that 58 per cent lack adequate legal 
protections for women’s land rights across family, inheritance and land laws. 
Many laws remain outdated, fragmented and misaligned with constitutional 
and international standards. 
In nearly 80 per cent of countries with data, fewer than half of women 
have ownership or secure rights to agricultural land. In nearly half of these 
countries, men are at least twice as likely to own land as women. Addressing 
both legal and practical gaps through comprehensive reforms and targeted 
interventions is crucial, particularly for marginalized groups, including 
indigenous women, ethnic and religious minorities, widows, and unmarried 
or divorced women. These efforts must also recognize land rights’ critical 
role in climate change mitigation and resilience.

Goal 5 | Gender equality
2024’s super election did little for gender parity in politics, revealing the need for bold reforms
As of 1 January 2025, women held 27.2 per cent of the seats in national 
parliaments; this is up 4.9 percentage points from 2015 but only 0.3 points 
from 2024, marking a slowdown compared to the average annual increase 
of nearly 0.5 points in the previous decade. Women’s representation in local 
government stagnated at 35.5 per cent after an average annual increase of 
0.4 points since 2020. 
The 2024 “super election” year was a missed opportunity to advance 
inclusive parliamentary representation and leadership. Although 59 
countries renewed their parliaments with a turnover of over 12,000 seats, 
the share of women and youth in parliament saw little change. A bright spot 
is the more balanced male-to-female ratio among younger members of 
parliament (57:43 for under age 30; 63:37 for under age 40). This suggests a 
more gender-balanced future as younger members advance into leadership 
positions. 
These findings highlight the need for bold reforms to challenge institutional 
and cultural barriers in politics. Potential game-changing measures include 
well-designed, ambitious quotas for elections and for appointments to 
leadership positions, as well as laws and policies of zero-tolerance for 
violence against women in politics.

Less than one third of managerial positions were 
held by women
Globally, women occupy less than a third of managerial positions. From 2015 to 
2023, their representation increased by only 2.4 percentage points, reaching 30 
per cent. At this pace, achieving gender parity in management will take nearly 
100 years. 
Progress varies dramatically by region. Australia and New Zealand and 
sub-Saharan Africa lead with over 40 per cent of women in managerial 
roles, followed by Europe and Northern America, and Latin America and the 
Caribbean at around 39 per cent. Meanwhile, Central and Southern Asia shows 
an alarming decline: from 15.1 per cent in 2015 to 11.6 per cent in 2023. Eastern 
and South-Eastern Asia also reversed progress (-2.3 percentage points), while 
in Northern Africa and Western Asia, less than one in five managerial roles are 
held by women despite a 6.7 percentage-point increase since 2015. Systemic 
barriers to employment and career advancement remain prevalent in these 
regions.  
Time-use data reveal persistent gender roles and 
unequal distribution of care and domestic chores
Women and girls continue to bear a disproportionate share of unpaid 
domestic and care work. Global time-use data underscore a persistent 
reality: on average, women devote two and a half times as many hours per 
day to these tasks as men. Women in Northern Africa and Western Asia 
spend over four times as many hours as men, while women in Oceania and 
Europe and Northern America spend approximately twice as many hours. 
The burden is particularly pronounced among the poorest households, 
where limited resources prevent outsourcing tasks or investing in time-
saving tools.
This unequal distribution reinforces existing gender roles, limiting women’s 
economic opportunities and perpetuating their marginalization in political, 
economic and social spheres. Addressing this imbalance requires policies 
such as improved social protection, investment in care infrastructure and 
family-friendly labour regulations to redistribute care responsibilities and 
support women’s economic participation. Without sustained action, both 
their rights and their potential will remain constrained.
Millions of women lack full decision-making 
power over their sexual and reproductive health
Despite global commitments, only 56.3 per cent of women aged 15–49 who 
are married or in a union have full decision-making power over their sexual 
and reproductive health and rights, according to data from 78 countries. 
Regional disparities are stark, from just 36.8 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa 
to 87.2 per cent in Europe. While 88.5 per cent of women can decide on 
contraceptive use, only 75.4 per cent can refuse sex, and 75 per cent can make 
healthcare decisions. Eastern and Southern Africa have seen progress, while 
many countries in Western and Central Africa have experienced significant 
regression. Educational and urban-rural disparities further hinder progress. 
The stagnation of progress highlights the urgent need to strengthen legal 
frameworks, expand access to services and implement locally tailored, data-
driven policies. Without sustained action, millions of women will continue 
to be denied agency over their bodies, compromising their rights, health and 
well-being.
Despite progress towards gender parity for 
mobile phone ownership, disparities persist in 
critical regions
In 2024, four out of five people aged 10 and older globally owned a mobile 
phone. Universal ownership (over 95 per cent) has been reached in Australia 
and New Zealand, and Europe and Northern America. Globally, 77 per cent 
of women owned a mobile phone, compared to 82 per cent of men, resulting 
in a gender parity score of 0.93. The gender gap is particularly wide in sub-
Saharan Africa, Central and Southern Asia, LDCs, and LLDCs, where parity 
scores fall below 0.82. Notably, SIDS have nearly closed the gender gap 
in mobile phone ownership and reached full parity in Internet use, despite 
having only two-thirds Internet penetration. Since 2021, the gender gap 
in mobile phone ownership has narrowed, from 9.4 to 7 per cent in 2024. 
However, among the population without mobile phones, there are nearly 
800 million women compared to 600 million  men.

Clean water and 
sanitation
• 
While steady progress expanded access to drinking water, sanitation and 
hygiene services between 2015 and 2024, billions remain underserved. 
In 2024, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.4 
billion went without safely managed sanitation and 1.7 billion lacked 
basic hygiene services at home. In schools, 646 million children remain 
without basic hygiene services, requiring a fourfold increase in progress 
to meet 2030 targets.
• 
Water systems are under strain from pollution, water stress and weak 
governance. Only 56 per cent of domestic wastewater is safely treated, 
water stress remains critical in several regions, freshwater ecosystems 
are declining, and transboundary cooperation is limited. At the current 
rate, the world will not achieve sustainable water management until at 
least 2049.
• 
Achieving Goal 6 requires mobilizing comprehensive financing 
mechanisms, leveraging innovative technologies, strengthening 
institutional capacity, fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships and 
integrating water management across all sectors and governance levels.
Uneven water stress threatens global development
Global water stress remained steady at 18 per cent in 2022 – unchanged 
since 2015, but regional disparities are stark. Many countries in Northern 
Africa and Western Asia, and Central and Southern Asia face critical water 
stress levels exceeding 75 per cent. Northern Africa and Western Asia have 
also experienced a concerning 12 per cent increase in water stress since 
2015. About 10 per cent of the global population now live under high or 
critical water stress. 
Economic sectors play a key role in shaping water stress levels. In 2022, 
agriculture accounted for 72 per cent of global freshwater withdrawals, 
followed by industry (15 per cent) and services (13 per cent). While essential 
for food security and economic growth, agriculture is both a driver and 
a casualty of water stress, making it one of the most vulnerable sectors. 
Addressing water stress demands smarter water management, improved 
agricultural water-use efficiency, strategic investments and policy reforms. 
In addition, subnational and temporal data are needed to uncover hidden 
vulnerabilities and guide targeted action.

Global water and sanitation access improves, but 
billions remain underserved
Between 2015 and 2024, global access to essential water, sanitation and 
hygiene (WASH) services steadily improved. The share of the population 
using safely managed drinking water rose from 68 to 74 per cent, safely 
managed sanitation coverage increased from 48 to 58 per cent, and basic 
hygiene services coverage grew from 66 to 80 per cent. Despite these 
gains, major challenges persist. In 2024, 2.2 billion people still lacked safely 
managed drinking water, 3.4 billion were without safely managed sanitation, 
and 1.7 billion lacked basic hygiene services at home. 
WASH access in schools remains insufficient for ensuring safe and inclusive 
learning environments. In 2023, although 77 per cent of schools provided 
basic drinking water services and 78 per cent offered basic sanitation, 447 
million and 427 million children, respectively, were still left without access to 
these essential facilities. Achieving universal coverage by 2030 will require 
doubling the current rate of progress. Alarmingly, only 67 per cent of schools 
offered basic hygiene services, leaving 646 million children unserved, 
necessitating a fourfold increase in progress.
Irregular monitoring leads to critical knowledge 
gaps about factors affecting water quality
In 2024, 56 per cent of global domestic wastewater generated (332 billion m3) 
was safely treated, largely unchanged from 2020. This finding is based on 
data from 130 Member States and 12 territories, covering 84 per cent of the 
global population. However, data on industrial wastewater remain scarce, 
with only 22 countries reporting. Comprehensive global reporting on total 
wastewater is not expected until 2027.
Water-quality monitoring improved, with 120 countries reporting in 
2023, up from 89 in 2020. Despite this progress, substantial monitoring 
disparities persist. Of the 2 million water-quality measurements collected 
globally, only 60,000 originated from the world’s poorest regions. It creates 
critical knowledge gaps about the impacts of pollution, climate change and 
biodiversity loss on freshwater systems, putting the health and livelihood 
of up to 4.8 billion people at risk by 2030. In situ data collected by national 
authorities are essential, but innovations such as citizen science and 
satellite-based Earth Observation also exist. Sierra Leone and Zambia have 
already used citizen-generated data to report, and other countries are also 
adopting this approach to help bridge data gaps.

Goal 6 | Clean water and sanitation
Water-use efficiency improves globally, but regional gaps persist
Between 2015 and 2022, global water-use efficiency rose by 23 per cent, 
from $17.5/m3 to $21.5/m3, reflecting gains in economic output without 
proportional increases in water use. However, 57 per cent of countries 
still operate below the global benchmark of $20/m3. Regional disparities 
are significant. Oceania and Europe and Northern America outperformed 
the global average, while Central and Southern Asia recorded the lowest 
efficiency levels.
The overall improvement was largely driven by economic growth, as total 
water withdrawal remained nearly unchanged. Sectoral trends show that 
municipal water use increased by 10 per cent, industrial use declined by 
5 per cent and agricultural withdrawals remained stable. Efficiency varied 
widely by sector in 2022: $38.5/m3 for industry, $114.4/m3 for services and 
just $0.7/m3 for agriculture. Despite the low baseline, agriculture showed 
the greatest relative gain, improving by 39.5 per cent over the period. 
Boosting efficiency, particularly in agriculture, is critical for water-stressed 
regions. This will require not only technological innovation, but also stronger 
governance, policy frameworks and institutional capacity-building.

Proven benefits of transboundary water 
cooperation need wider implementation
Transboundary water cooperation supports sustainable development, 
climate resilience and conflict prevention. Long-standing partnerships 
– such as the 50-year collaboration on the Senegal River and the Brazil-
Paraguay cooperation through the Itaipu Commission – have improved water 
access, irrigation, energy security and drought resilience. Despite these 
benefits, cooperation remains limited. Of the 153 Member States sharing 
transboundary waters, only 43 have operational arrangements covering over 
90 per cent of their shared basins. More than 20 countries lack any such 
arrangements, with Asia and Latin America particularly lagging. Progress has 
been slow, with just eight countries increasing the coverage of operational 
arrangements in their territory between 2020 and 2023.
Only 50 per cent of transboundary river and lake basins have joint flood 
warning systems, and even fewer have joint disaster risk reduction (20 per 
cent) or climate change adaptation strategies (14 per cent). To accelerate 
progress by 2030, countries must strengthen political will, increase climate 
and development finance, invest in capacity-building, and make greater use 
of the global United Nations water conventions.
Freshwater ecosystems are under pressure 
despite improved monitoring 
Freshwater ecosystem degradation threatens biodiversity, food security and 
livelihoods. Since 1970, 83 per cent of freshwater species populations have 
declined, and 25 per cent of freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction. 
In 2015, 61 per cent of countries reported one or more degraded water-
related ecosystem types. Encouragingly, this figure dropped to 31 per cent 
in the 2017–2021 period. However, the inclusion of new water-quality data 
indicated less progress, pushing the proportion back to 50 per cent. Regional 
disparities are significant: over 60 per cent of countries in Central Asia, 
South-Eastern Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa report degradation, compared 
to 21 per cent in Oceania. Loss of permanent surface water in 364 river 
basins driven by unsustainable practices and climate change has impacted 
over 93 million people.
Despite the growing use of Earth Observation data, only one third of 
countries have national wetland inventories, limiting the quality and use of 
national data. Reversing degradation requires urgent investment in digital 
monitoring, capacity-building and evidence-based policies to protect and 
restore freshwater ecosystems.
Slow progress is seen for integrated water resources management, with insufficient financing a major 
barrier
Global progress on integrated water resources management (IWRM) 
remains slow, with implementation rising from 49 per cent  in 2017 to 57 per 
cent in 2023. While 47 countries (26 per cent) have reached or are close to 
the “very high” implementation target, 73 countries (40 per cent) are being 
left behind. Insufficient financing remains a major barrier, where 60 per 
cent of countries lack effective revenue-raising mechanisms, and about 70 
per cent report inadequate funding for water management at subnational 
levels. Strengthening the link between IWRM and climate adaptation offers 
untapped potential, but coordination, capacity and financing gaps persist. 
Despite strong political commitments, cross-sector coordination remains 
a challenge, with only half of countries reporting formal arrangements. 
Progress on gender mainstreaming in water management is also slow, with 
global scores rising slightly from 54 per cent in 2020 to 58 per cent in 2023. 
However, 15 per cent of countries still lacked any gender mechanisms, and 31 
per cent reported limited implementation.

Affordable and clean 
energy
• 
The world has made considerable progress towards Goal 7. Global 
electricity access reached 92 per cent in 2023 – up from 84 per cent in 
2010. Meanwhile, access to clean cooking fuels and technologies rose 
from 64 to 74 per cent between 2015 and 2023. Renewable energy is the 
fastest-growing energy source today, and it is projected to surpass coal 
as the primary electricity source in 2025.
• 
However, achieving Goal 7 targets demands substantially increasing 
clean-energy investments, particularly in developing economies. 
Without accelerated investments and action, 645 million people will still 
lack electricity access, and 1.8 billion will lack access to clean cooking in 
2030.
• 
Meeting global climate targets and net-zero emission warrants the rapid 
deployment of renewable energy across all sectors and more significant 
improvements in energy efficiency. Tailored and integrated policy 
interventions and actions remain essential to advancing just energy 
transitions and to meeting climate objectives. 
The past decade saw 45 countries achieving universal electricity access, but little progress in  
sub-Saharan Africa
Global electricity access reached 92 per cent in 2023, up from 84 per cent in 
2010, with the number of people without electricity dropping to 666.4 million 
– 18.8 million fewer than in 2022. Between 2010 and 2023, 45 countries 
achieved universal electricity access. However, regional disparities persist. 
Central and Southern Asia reduced its unconnected population from 414 
million in 2010 to 27 million in 2023. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa saw little 
progress, with its unconnected population barely changing from 566 million to 
565 million – despite coverage rising from 33 to 53 per cent – accounting for 
85 per cent of the global electricity deficit. In addition, globally, 84 per cent of 
people without electricity in 2023 lived in rural communities.
Achieving universal access by 2030 requires accelerating electrification to 
1.2 per cent annually. Unfortunately, current trends indicate that in 2030, 
645 million people will remain without power. Addressing this challenge will 
require fresh thinking, renewed political commitment and additional funding 
to scale up the adoption of distributed renewable-energy technologies and 
business models. Off-grid solar solutions present the most cost-effective 
pathway – potentially bringing electricity to 389 million people.

Access to clean cooking has improved, but it is far from universal
Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 74 per cent globally 
in 2023, up from 64 per cent in 2015. Yet, approximately 2.1 billion people 
still rely on polluting fuels for cooking. Regional progress varies dramatically. 
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, along with Central and Southern Asia, have 
made substantial gains in expanding clean cooking access. However, sub-
Saharan Africa continues to face critical challenges, with only 21 per cent of 
the population having access to clean cooking.
The burden falls heaviest on poorer households, particularly affecting 
women and girls, who spend extensive time gathering fuel and cooking 
on inefficient stoves. This compromises their health, limits educational 
opportunities and reduces economic prospects. Current progress indicates 
that only 78 per cent of the global population will have access to clean 
cooking solutions by 2030, leaving approximately 1.8 billion people without 
access. Achieving universal access requires urgent action and accelerated 
efforts.

Goal 7 | Affordable and clean energy
Global energy consumption is increasingly supported by renewables, but more is needed to achieve 
ambitions
The share of renewable energy in the world’s total final energy consumption 
increased from 15.6 per cent in 2015 to 17.9 per cent in 2022, with modern 
renewables (excluding traditional biomass) increasing from 10 to 13 per 
cent. The electricity sector leads the growth, with renewables comprising 
30 per cent of its 2022 global electricity consumption. Hydropower 
remained the predominant renewable electricity source, while wind and 
solar demonstrated the largest absolute growth – tripling their combined 
consumption in 2022 compared to 2015. Renewable sources accounted 
for around 21 per cent of global energy use for heat, with almost half from 
traditional biomass. In the transport sector, only 4 per cent of consumption 
was from renewables, of which nearly 90 per cent came from biofuels.
Raising renewable-energy deployment targets, implementing stronger policy 
actions across all end-use sectors and expanding support to developing 
countries will be pivotal in advancing towards Goal 7 and meeting climate 
objectives.

Energy intensity progress accelerated in 2022 
partly due to energy crisis, but the world is not 
yet on track
Primary energy intensity (the ratio of total energy supply to GDP) improved 
by 2.1 per cent in 2022; this is more than quadruple the improvement rate 
in 2021, bringing the worldwide intensity to 3.87 megajoules per dollar 
(2021 PPP). This progress was partly driven by the reduced energy use 
amid the global energy crisis and high prices in 2022. Among the top 20 
energy-consuming countries, 15 experienced accelerated progress during 
2010–2022 compared to 1990–2010; nine nations more than doubled their 
average annual energy-intensity improvement rate.  
Meeting Goal 7 targets on energy efficiency requires annual improvements 
of 4.0 per cent between 2022 and 2030. This ambitious goal is consistent 
with agreements from the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference. 
The uptake of renewable energy to generate electricity, as well as the energy 
efficiency of end-use sectors (such as buildings and transport) will play key 
roles in achieving targets.
Installed renewable energy-generating capacity 
is on a continuous rise, yet significant disparities 
persist 
Global installed renewable-energy capacity per capita hit a record 478 
watts per person in 2023, marking an annual growth of 13 per cent, driven 
primarily by China, Brazil and India. This achievement reflects strong 
momentum, with a 9.4 per cent compound annual growth rate over 
the past five years. However, significant disparities remain. Developed 
countries average 1,162 watts per person – nearly three times the average of 
developing countries, 341 watts. While developing countries now account for 
43.5 per cent of the global capacity to generate electricity from renewables, 
this progress masks profound inequalities. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia 
increased over threefold from 207 to 741 watts per person between 2013 
and 2023, while sub-Saharan Africa lags with just 40 watts per person. The 
most vulnerable are LDCs (40 watts), LLDCs (105 watts) and SIDS (110 
watts). At current rates, LDCs would need 46 years to reach the average of 
today’s developing countries. Without accelerated deployment of cost-
effective renewable solutions, these disparities will widen, undermining the 
global energy transition and sustainability goals. 
International financial flows continue to rebound, but remain short of 2016 peaks 
International financial support of clean and renewable energy to developing 
countries reached $21.6 billion in 2023, an increase of 27 per cent from 
2022. Solar energy led the growth, with funding rising 84 per cent to 
$9.4 billion, accounting for 44 per cent of total financial flows. Wind and 
hydropower also grew by 41 per cent (reaching $2.4 billion) and 61 per cent 
($2.3 billion), respectively. However, despite this third consecutive year 
of growth, 2023 flows amounted to only about three quarters of the 2016 
peak of $28.4 billion. In addition, in 2023, 80 per cent of commitments 
were distributed among 29 countries, compared to the 25 in 2022. Overall 
financial support lags far behind the actual needs of developing countries, 
particularly among LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. To enable global progress 
towards Goal 7, it will be crucial to accelerate this growth trajectory while 
ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds.

Decent work and 
economic growth
• 
Global economic growth is falling short. GDP per capita growth is 
projected to slow to just 1.5 per cent in 2025 due to heightened trade 
tensions and policy uncertainty. Real GDP growth in LDCs remains well 
below the 7 per cent target. Weak productivity growth and declining 
labour rights compliance further undermine decent-work progress.
• 
While the unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.0 per cent in 
2024, nearly 58 per cent of workers remained informally employed, 
with persistently high rates in LDCs and sub-Saharan Africa. Youth and 
women continued to face particularly elevated unemployment and NEET 
(not in education, employment or training) rates. 
• 
To achieve decent work for all, Governments must accelerate 
comprehensive strategies including formalization pathways for informal 
workers, enhanced social protection systems, strengthened labour rights 
enforcement, and investments in green and digital economy initiatives, 
while ensuring equitable access to finance and economic opportunities, 
particularly as global economic uncertainties intensify.
Trade tensions and uncertainty are expected to dampen GDP growth in 2025
Global real GDP per capita declined sharply by 3.8 per cent in 2020 due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Although it rebounded by 5.5 per cent in 2021, growth 
slowed to around 2 per cent between 2022 and 2024. Heightened trade 
tensions, along with policy uncertainty, have significantly weakened the global 
economic outlook for 2025, with growth projected to slow to 1.5 per cent. 
Between 2010 and 2014, the global real GDP per capita grew by 2.0 per cent 
annually, but slowed to 1.7 per cent for 2015–2023. This deceleration reflects 
modest slowdowns in most regions and actual declines in sub-Saharan Africa, 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania (excluding Australia and New 
Zealand). LDCs saw growth fall from 3.5 to 1.6 per cent between these periods, 
while LLDCs dropped more steeply, from 3.9 to 1.5 per cent. These slowdowns 
pose serious risks to poverty reduction, economic resilience and sustainable 
transformation.
Real GDP growth in LDCs also remains well below the 7 per cent annual target 
set by the 2030 Agenda. After a sharp drop to 0.5 per cent in 2020, growth 
partially recovered to 4.7 per cent in 2022 before slowing again to 3.5 per cent 
in 2023 and an estimated 3.1 per cent in 2024.

Global productivity is rebounding slowly, with 
persistent regional gaps
Labour productivity, measured as GDP per worker per hour, is a key indicator 
of economic and labour market efficiency. Globally, labour productivity 
growth rebounded to 1.5 per cent in 2024 after near stagnation in 2022 
and 2023, but remains below the 2015–2019 average of 1.8 per cent. The 
COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in 2020, and momentum has 
yet to fully recover. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia showed consistently 
strong growth, averaging 3.2 per cent from 2020 to 2024, and Central 
and Southern Asia surpassed 3 per cent in 2024. On the other hand, Latin 
America and the Caribbean saw negative productivity growth of –1.1 per cent 
during 2015–2019, but moved towards modest positive growths in 2023 and 
2024. Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), 
and Northern Africa and Western Asia experienced near-zero productivity 
growth in 2023 and 2024. Weak productivity growth hinders decent work 
opportunities and real wage increases, complicating sustainable economic 
recovery and highlighting the need for policies boosting productivity and 
resilience.
Efforts to end child labour show signs of progress 
despite missing the 2025 target  
While the elimination of child labour remains an unfinished global challenge, 
recent data provide cautiously optimistic news. Following the concerning rise 
in child labour documented in 2020, the feared further deterioration in the 
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has not materialized. Instead, the world has 
successfully returned to a trajectory of progress. 
In 2024, approximately 138 million children worldwide engaged in child 
labour, including 54 million in hazardous work endangering their health 
and development. This represents a significant decrease from 160 million 
children four years ago. Since 2000, over 100 million fewer children have 
been in child labour despite the global child population increasing by 230 
million. However, the world missed its ambitious target of ending child 
labour by 2025. To achieve the target within the next five years, the current 
rate of progress would need to accelerate elevenfold.

Goal 8 | Decent work and economic growth
Over half of the global workforce remains in informal employment, with numbers still rising
Since 2015, the share of workers in informal employment has edged upward. 
By 2024, 57.8 per cent of the global workforce was informally employed, 
meaning they were not adequately covered by social security arrangements, 
legal protection or workplace safety measures. The 0.2 percentage-point 
increase from the previous year translates to over 34 million additional 
informal workers. Although the rate is projected to dip slightly to 57.7 
per cent by 2026, another 38 million are expected to enter informal 
employment. 
Informality is highest in low-income countries. In 2024, nearly 9 in 10 
workers in sub-Saharan Africa and LDCs were informally employed. 
Northern Africa and Western Asia, as well as SIDS, saw informality 
increasing since 2015. 
Women are particularly vulnerable in regions where informality is rampant. 
In 2024, 93.8 per cent of women in LDCs and 91.4 per cent in sub-Saharan 
Africa were informally employed, compared to 86.4 and 86.0 per cent of 
men, respectively. Without stronger policies focusing on job quality, informal 
employment will continue to hinder decent work and inclusive development.

Tourism recovery gains ground but disparities persist
Tourism holds significant potential to drive sustainable development, 
livelihoods and nature conservation. In 2023, tourism’s share of the global 
GDP rebounded to 3.4 per cent, representing over 90 per cent of the 2019 
pre-pandemic level and above the 2015–2023 average of 3.3 per cent. 
From 2015 to 2023, Latin America and the Caribbean led with tourism 
contributing  4.3 per cent of their GDP, while Central and Southern Asia 
lagged at 2.2 per cent. When examining countries in special developing 
status, SIDS showed particularly high dependence on tourism, with the 
sector averaging 13 per cent of their GDP during this period (excluding 
Singapore). In contrast, LDCs and LLDCs show considerably lower tourism 
contributions, at 2.4 and 1.9 per cent, respectively, highlighting the need for 
targeted investment. 
Tourism is also a major source of employment, accounting for 5.6 per cent 
of global employment between 2015 and 2023, based on data reported by 
89 countries. SIDS again stood out with tourism responsible for 12.9 per 
cent of their total number of employed persons, compared to lower rates in 
sub-Saharan Africa (2.8 per cent) and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (4.4 
per cent). 
Youth face persistent challenges in labour markets despite record-low unemployment 
The global unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.0 per cent in 2024, 
down from 6.0 per cent in 2015. But disparities and vulnerabilities remain in 
the labour market, particularly for youth and women. Youth unemployment, 
while improving to 12.9 per cent in 2024, remains triple the adult rate of 3.7 
per cent. 
Meanwhile, one in five young people (aged 15–24) globally were NEET in 
2024, leaving 259 million youth without opportunities to build skills or gain 
work experience. This rate has stayed persistently high, with a mere 0.9 
percentage-point decrease since 2015.  Young women face the greatest 
barriers and are twice as likely to be NEET as young men. In Central and 
Southern Asia, 41.9 per cent of young women were NEET, compared to 11.5 
per cent of young men. Tackling this challenge requires structural reforms that 
expand access to education, training and decent work – especially for young 
women.

Continued erosion of compliance with labour rights undermines progress towards decent-work 
objectives
Freedom of association and collective bargaining rights are crucial for 
achieving decent-work objectives. Between 2015 and 2023, global 
compliance with these fundamental labour rights deteriorated, with the 
average national compliance score declining by 7 per cent – from 4.54 to 
4.86 (on a scale where 0 represents the highest compliance and 10 indicates 
the lowest. Five of seven regions saw declines, with Eastern and South-
Eastern Asia performing the worst. The most severe deterioration occurred 
among LDCs, which experienced a 45.5 per cent decline in compliance. 
Developed economies declined by 16.5 per cent. 
The deterioration continues to be driven heavily by violations of fundamental 
civil liberties of workers, employers and their organizations. As free and 
independent workers’ and employers’ organizations are the very essence 
of democracy, continued violation of rights further erodes the civic space 
necessary for the functioning of genuine democracies.

Industry, innovation and 
infrastructure
• 
Since 2015, notable progress has been made in expanding infrastructure, 
fostering industrial growth and boosting innovation. Global 
manufacturing value added (MVA) per capita grew 17.3 per cent from 
2015 to 2024. Maritime freight reached 11.6 billion metric tons in 2023, 
driven by the growing participation of developing countries. Meanwhile, 
5G mobile broadband now covers 51 per cent of the global population. 
However, stark regional disparities persist, and many developing 
countries continue to face systemic barriers to inclusive and sustainable 
industrialization.
• 
Emissions hit a new high despite clean energy growth. Carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes rose to a 
record 37.6 billion metric tons in 2024, up 8.3 per cent since 2015. Clean 
energy technologies helped curb further growth, but global emissions 
continue to rise amid increasing energy demand.
• 
To advance towards Goal 9, countries must boost investment in resilient 
infrastructure and research and development (R&D), expand access 
to financing for small manufacturers, and bridge the digital divide by 
prioritizing affordable broadband and innovation systems in the world’s 
most underserved regions. 
Developing countries handle the majority of world maritime freight volumes 
Global maritime freight has transformed over the past two decades amid 
globalization, technological change, global disruptions and geopolitical 
challenges. In 2023, maritime freight volumes reached 11.6 billion metric 
tons, up from 6.2 and 10.3 billion metric tons in 2000 and 2015, respectively, 
showing remarkable resilience.  
Developing countries have dramatically shifted from primarily exporting 
raw materials to becoming major importers and exporters of finished and 
semi-finished products. Their share of global maritime freight grew from 38 
per cent in 2000 to 49 per cent in 2015 and 54 per cent in 2023, overtaking 
developed economies in 2017. Asia, particularly China, led this growth while 
Europe’s share declined. The Americas showed moderate progress. LDCs 
and SIDS contribute limited shares, reflecting their trade structure, economic 
size, transport infrastructure and marginalization from global manufacturing 
networks and supply chains.

Global manufacturing growth shows progress, but with regional disparities 
Since 2015, global MVA per capita has grown by 17.3 per cent, from $1,649 
(at constant 2015 prices) to $1,934 in 2024. After a smaller 1.6 per cent 
annual growth in 2023, the sector rebounded with an estimated 2.7 per 
cent annual growth in 2024. However, the MVA share of the global GDP 
has remained steady at 16.5 per cent in both 2023 and 2024. Central and 
Southern Asia saw the strongest gains, with the MVA per capita increasing 
by 42.1 per cent from 2015 to 2024. Meanwhile, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, and Australia and New Zealand experienced 
declines of 5.9, 8.0 and 10.5 per cent, respectively. LDCs showed an 
impressive 40.6 per cent growth in MVA per capita since 2015, but this still 
falls short of the 2030 target to double the MVA share of their GDP. 
Manufacturing employment dropped from 14.3 per cent of global 
employment in 2015 to 14.2 per cent in 2024, due to COVID-19 disruptions, 
supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions – signalling weakened industrial 
capacity and resilience. Most regions have seen a decline in manufacturing 
employment since 2015, with Australia and New Zealand facing the steepest 
drop of 1.9 percentage points.

Goal 9 | Industry, innovation and infrastructure
Global CO2 emissions hit record high despite clean energy gains
Global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes surged 
to a record high of 37.6 gigatons (Gt; 1 Gt = 1 billion metric tons) in 2024, 
marking a 0.8 per cent increase from 2023 and 8.3 per cent from 2015. 
While emissions from industrial processes declined, emissions from fuel 
combustion rose by 1 per cent, driven by increased natural-gas and coal 
consumption.
Emerging markets and developing economies contributed to a 1.5 per cent 
rise in energy-related emissions, driven by rapid population and economic 
growth. Conversely, advanced economies saw a decrease, with emission cut 
by 1.1 per cent, mainly through reductions in coal and oil use. Record-high 
global temperatures in 2024 led to greater electricity demand for cooling, 
adding approximately 0.230 Gt of CO2 emissions. Despite these challenges, 
the expansion of clean energy technologies has significantly curbed 
emissions growth. Between 2019 and 2024, the expansion of solar power, 
wind power, nuclear energy, electric cars and heat pumps prevented 2.6 Gt 
of annual CO2 emissions. Without these technologies, the increase in global 
emissions since 2019 would have been three times larger. 
Access to 5G now reaches half the globe, but some have zero mobile-broadband network access 
Although 5G coverage has expanded to reach 51 per cent of the global 
population in 2024 – just five years since its commercial launch in 2019 – 
progress is uneven. While 84 per cent of people in high-income countries 
have access to 5G, coverage is only 4 per cent in low-income nations.
Where 5G technology is unavailable, 4G remains a strong alternative, 
covering 92 per cent of the world population. Yet, in low-income countries, 
4G coverage reaches only 52 per cent of the population, and 3G remains a 
crucial technology for Internet connectivity.
Despite advancements, 4 per cent of the global population remains beyond 
the reach of mobile broadband; the largest gaps are in Oceania (excluding 
Australia and New Zealand), where 24 per cent do not have any access. 
LDCs and LLDCs also face significant challenges, with 15 and 14 per cent of 
their populations, respectively, lacking mobile-broadband access.

Despite global growth in research capacity, certain regions are left behind 
Since 2015, the global research workforce has grown annually by 4.3 per 
cent, from 1,137 to 1,420 researchers per million people in 2022. Eastern 
and South-Eastern Asia led this surge with a 5.3 per cent growth rate, while 
Europe and Northern America continued to have the highest researcher 
densities, increasing from 3,513 to 4,254 per million inhabitants. Meanwhile, 
sub-Saharan Africa remained stagnant at 91 researchers per million, 
underscoring persistent disparities in research capacity.
Global investment in R&D grew by 5.1 per cent annually from 2015 to 2022, 
despite COVID-19 disruptions. The share of the global GDP invested in R&D 
climbed from 1.72 to 1.95 per cent during this period, driven largely by Europe 
and Northern America as well as Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. However, 
Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as Central and Southern Asia, saw 
decreases. To foster inclusive and sustainable innovation, stronger policy 
commitments are essential for building research capacity in developing 
regions and for narrowing global gaps.
More inclusive financing is needed for small enterprises 
According to global survey data from 2006 to 2024, only 31 per cent of 
small manufacturing enterprises have a loan or line of credit, revealing 
low financial accessibility as a significant barrier to growth. In today’s 
economic climate – marked by geopolitical tensions, economic sanctions 
and rising uncertainty – small enterprises are especially vulnerable to shocks, 
particularly in lower-income countries, where financial risks are significantly 
higher. Just 18 per cent of small-scale manufacturing firms in sub-Saharan 
Africa received loans or lines of credit, compared to the 46 per cent in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Improving financial inclusion and providing 
targeted policy support can help bridge this gap, ensuring that small 
enterprises can thrive despite economic uncertainties.

Reduced inequalities
• 
Since 2015, most countries have seen income and consumption growth 
for the bottom 40 per cent of their population outpace the national 
average, though disparities persist among regions and countries at 
different income levels. The labour income share of GDP fails to show 
progress, contributing to rising inequality.
• 
Reports of discrimination are rising globally, with higher prevalence 
among urban residents, women, persons with disabilities, the poorest 
and those with lower education levels.
• 
The global refugee population has surged to 37.8 million – primarily 
from Afghanistan, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Syrian Arab 
Republic and Ukraine – intensifying humanitarian pressures.
• 
Total resource flows to developing countries have increased, with official 
development assistance (ODA) forming a larger share. Given current 
trends in international cooperation, however, the future of ODA appears 
uncertain and potentially constrained.
• 
Getting Goal 10 back on track will require providing extra support 
for vulnerable population groups, combating rising discrimination, 
protecting labour income and introducing structural reforms to boost 
growth in emerging and developing economies.
Poorer economies are less likely to experience above-average growth among the bottom 40 per cent of 
the population  
Since 2015, about 6 in 10 of the 108 countries with at least two recent 
surveys have achieved higher income and consumption growth for the 
bottom 40 per cent of the population compared to the national average. 
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, as well as Europe and Northern America, 
demonstrated more consistent pro-poor growth on average, both before and 
after the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, in Central and Southern Asia, 
only three out of seven countries with available data managed higher growth 
for the bottom 40 per cent relative to the national average.
Fewer than half of low- and lower-middle-income countries have managed 
to foster higher growth among the bottom 40 per cent compared to the 
national average. In contrast, 7 out of 10 upper-middle- and high-income 
countries have achieved more rapid growth for their bottom 40 per cent.
 
Less of GDP is going towards labour income, increasing the gap between workers and owners of capital  
In 2024, 57 per cent of working-age persons were employed worldwide, 
meaning that labour income directly impacts the lives of 3.6 billion workers 
and their families. Globally, the labour income share of GDP fell from 52.9 per 
cent in 2015 to 52.3 per cent in 2024, equivalent to an average loss of $255 
(in 2021 PPP) per worker annually. This decline signals that productivity gains 
are not translating into higher wages. Instead, a growing share of economic 
gains is going to capital, concentrated among the wealthy, thereby widening 
inequality.
Most regions saw a decline in the labour income share between 2015 and 
2024, a period marked by COVID-19’s economic impacts. The drop was 
particularly sharp in SIDS (2.6 percentage points), LLDCs (1.4 percentage 
points), and Latin America and the Caribbean (1.3 percentage points). 
Conversely, Central and Southern Asia experienced an increase. LDCs also 
saw a minor rise, albeit from a much lower base.

Goal 10 | Reduced inequalities
Discrimination is on the rise globally, with certain population groups bearing the brunt 
Fresh evidence from 119 countries reveals who is being left behind and a 
troubling upward trajectory in global discrimination. Among countries with 
multiple survey rounds, average discrimination on any ground increased 
from 14.8 to 17.1 per cent. Nations experiencing rising discrimination 
outnumber those making progress by two to one.
Discrimination is neither rare nor random. It is a widespread and patterned 
experience, deeply rooted in social identity and status. Globally, one in five 
people report having been discriminated against on at least one ground 
prohibited by international law in the past 12 months, with LDCs reporting 
the highest rates averaging 24.3 per cent. 
Key disparities emerge across demographics. Urban residents report nearly 
double the discrimination rate of their rural counterparts. Women are twice 
as likely to face gender-based discrimination. Persons with disabilities face 
discrimination at 28 per cent compared to the 17 per cent for those without 
disabilities. Economic status strongly correlates with discrimination; the 
poorest quintile reports a 17.3 per cent rate versus the 10.3 per cent rate 
reported by the wealthiest. Education matters as individuals with no formal 
education face a 21.4 per cent rate, nearly double that of those with higher 
education (12.7 per cent). Age shapes the reasons for discrimination. Youth 
(15–29 years) more often report discrimination based on migration status, 
ethnicity and sexual orientation, while older adults (60+ years) encounter 
age, disability and health-related discrimination.

Global refugee population surges to 37.8 million
By mid-2024, the global refugee population under the mandate of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), including persons in 
refugee-like situations and others needing international protection, reached 
37.8 million. Two thirds of all refugees originate from just four countries: 
Afghanistan, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Syrian Arab Republic 
and Ukraine. The global refugee ratio stood at 460 per 100,000 people 
worldwide – more than twice the rate in 2015 and over three times the level 
in 2005.
Remittance costs remain stubbornly high, far exceeding SDG target  
The global average cost of sending $200 was 6.7 per cent in the second 
quarter of 2024, more than double the SDG target of 3 per cent and up from 
6.2 per cent a year earlier. Digital remittances, which made up 30 per cent 
of transactions, averaged 5.3 per cent, while non-digital methods cost 7.2 
per cent. The cost of sending money from the Group of 20  countries, which 
represent a significant source of remittances globally, increased slightly 
more than the global average cost. All developing-country regions posted 
an increase in total average costs, except Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Contributing factors included higher foreign-exchange margins and increased 
fees in some corridors, and a temporary suspension of several low-cost 
services due to the end of exclusive partnerships between providers.
Banks continued to be the most expensive channel, costing 13.4 per cent in 
2024, up from 12.1 per cent in 2023. The average cost for post offices was 
7.5 per cent and 5.6 per cent for money transfer operators. Mobile operators 
charged the lowest rate at 3.9 per cent, but they accounted for less than 1 per 
cent of the total transaction volume.

Resource flows for developing countries increase, with official development assistance making up a 
bigger share of the total
Total resource flows to developing countries reached $429 billion in 2023, an 
increase from $290 billion in 2015 (in constant 2023 prices). ODA dominated 
these flows at $259 billion, with its share of total flows rising from 55 per 
cent in 2015 to 60 per cent in 2023. Other official flows amounted to $48.6 
billion, and private sector instruments were $5.5 billion. Private flows, which 
are more volatile and fell sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, recovered 
to $116 billion. 
Asia received the largest volume of flows at $141 billion (32 per cent of 
total flows) in 2023, followed by Africa at $91 billion (21 per cent). LDCs 
received $80 billion. The United States, Germany and Japan were the 
largest contributors, providing $175.7 billion, $73.7 billion and $45.9 billion, 
respectively.

Sustainable cities and 
communities
• 
With rapid urbanization and now over half the world’s population living 
in cities, housing affordability has reached crisis levels. Up to 3 billion 
people worldwide struggle to afford a place to live, and 1.12 billion live in 
slums or informal settlements without basic services.  
• 
Climate threats intensify urban vulnerabilities. Cities are central 
to climate change efforts as urban populations grow, with rising 
temperatures and flood risks threatening billions. Open green spaces are 
disappearing, undermining climate resilience. 
• 
Only 19 per cent of cities across 50 countries demonstrate strong civil 
society participation in urban planning, threatening equity and effective 
service delivery, particularly for marginalized groups.
• 
Creating safe, resilient and sustainable cities requires coordinated 
investments in affordable housing, climate-resilient infrastructure and 
inclusive governance. Cities must strengthen land access, improve 
transportation and expand financing while prioritizing green-space 
restoration and climate-smart planning in underserved areas. This 
integrated approach – combining infrastructure, financing and 
participatory governance – is essential for inclusive cities that leave no 
one behind.
Housing affordability crisis affects up to 3 billion people worldwide
Housing affordability has reached crisis levels amid rapid urbanization, 
impacting between 1.6 and 3 billion people worldwide. Alarmingly, 1.12 
billion individuals live in slums or informal settlements, facing challenges 
such as overcrowding, homelessness and lack of basic services. Data from 
124 countries show that, in 2023, the global average housing cost burden 
– the proportion of a household’s income on housing expenses such as 
rent or mortgage payments and utilities – stood at 31.0 per cent, with stark 
disparities across regions. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced the highest 
burden at 43.5 per cent, followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia at 
36.9 per cent. Meanwhile, Europe and Northern America reported a lower 
burden, at 21.4 per cent, thanks to stronger regulatory frameworks and 
financial support systems.
Solving the housing affordability crisis requires upgrading informal and 
public housing while enabling private markets to better serve low-income 
groups. Key enablers include accessible peri-urban land, strong transport 
connectivity, streamlined regulations, secure tenure and wider access to 
mortgages and microfinance. Reliable and disaggregated data are also 
critical for guiding effective policies to ensure affordable housing and 
inclusive urban development for everyone.

Rapid urbanization calls for a focus on urban climate adaptation
With half the global population currently residing in cities and this proportion 
projected to increase to 70 per cent by 2050, cities play a crucial role in 
fighting climate change. By 2040, more than 2 billion urban residents could 
face an additional temperature rise of at least 0.5°C, and 36 per cent of the 
global urban population may endure annual mean temperatures of 29°C or 
higher. Flood risks are also escalating. In 2025, 1 billion people live in areas 
prone to severe riverine flooding, half of them in cities. Since 1975, urban 
flood exposure has surged to 3.5 times that of rural areas, worsening climate 
vulnerabilities.  
Green spaces in urban areas, a key factor in climate resilience, shrank from 
19.5 per cent in 1990 to just 13.9 per cent in 2020. Cities require $4.5 trillion 
to $5.4 trillion annually through 2030 for climate-resilient infrastructure, but 
they secured only $831 billion yearly for 2021–2022. Just over 1 per cent of 
this funding was directed towards adaptation measures.  
Governments and global organizations must prioritize urban climate action 
through low-carbon and resilient housing, by re-establishing open spaces 
and green areas, and by fostering multilevel governance. Initiatives such 
as the Local2030 Coalition accelerate progress by sharing best practices 
and mobilizing resources. Closing data gaps and driving innovation will be 
essential for cities to mitigate and to adapt swiftly to worsening climate 
threats.

Goal 11 | Sustainable cities and communities
Local disaster risk reduction strategies gain 
momentum amid mounting infrastructure threats 
from climate disasters
Disasters continue to damage critical infrastructure and disrupt essential 
services despite growing investments aimed at resilience. From 2015 to 2023, 
based on data from 115 reporting countries, an average of 92,199 infrastructure 
units were impaired or destroyed each year, and over 1.6 million annual service 
disruptions occurred – particularly in education and healthcare. Building 
disaster- and climate-resilient infrastructure remains a strategic priority, 
requiring sustained funding and political commitment.
Localizing disaster risk reduction is key to reducing losses and ensuring no one 
is left behind – especially women, girls and marginalized groups. As of 2024, 
110 countries report local disaster risk reduction strategies aligned with national 
plans, with an average of 73 per cent of municipalities implementing them.
Limited civil society participation undermines 
inclusive urban planning
Limited civil society participation in urban planning and management 
remains a major barrier to inclusive and sustainable urban development. 
A 2024 survey of 152 cities in 50 countries found only 19 per cent of 
cities (29 cities) demonstrated strong civil society participation in urban 
planning, while 18 per cent showed medium participation, 35 per cent low 
participation and 29 per cent very limited or no participation.
This lack of civic engagement in decision-making processes threatens urban 
equity, effective service delivery and trust in institutions – disproportionately 
affecting marginalized groups such as women, youth, persons with 
disabilities and slum dwellers. To enhance inclusive urban development 
cities must invest in robust systems to empower and facilitate meaningful 
participation by all population groups in the planning, managing, budgeting 
and decision-making processes.
Rapid urban expansion necessitates better coverage of municipal solid waste collection
As cities expand rapidly, managing municipal solid waste has become a 
critical challenge. Despite global efforts, wide regional disparities persist 
in waste collection coverage, exposing inequalities in infrastructure, 
governance and access to basic services. Between 2010 and 2024, data from 
4,383 cities reveal that Europe and Northern America lead with an average 
collection coverage of 99.4 per cent, followed by Australia and New Zealand 
(98.9 per cent). Other regions, such as Northern Africa and Western Asia 
(94.8 per cent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (90.6 per cent) show 
strong performance. However, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (64.7 per 
cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (62.6 per cent) face the greatest challenges.
Closing these gaps demands coordinated investment in collection 
infrastructure, supportive policies and financial incentives. Cities should 
leverage digital tools, smart bins  and waste-to-energy technologies, as well 
as foster public-private partnerships and community engagement to ensure 
clean, healthy urban environments.

Despite progress in national urban policies, 
financing at the local level lags behind
National urban policies (NUPs) are key to sustainable urban development, 
but they can only succeed when they are effectively implemented, financed 
and monitored. In the 2023 global NUP review, 68 countries reported NUPs 
meeting at least one qualifier of SDG indicator 11.a.1. Between 2021 and 
2023, the number of countries addressing population dynamics rose from 
54 to 59 (87 per cent of respondents), while the number ensuring balanced 
territorial development remained constant at 55 (81 per cent). The number of 
countries enhancing local fiscal space grew from 26 in 2021 (45 per cent) to 
33 in 2023 (49 per cent). While these gains are evident, accelerating fiscal 
decentralization remains a critical priority for urban policies.  
To unlock their full potential, NUPs must be grounded in robust data, aligned 
with national reform agendas, and backed by clear frameworks for national-
local financial empowerment and local revenue mobilization – enabling cities 
to innovate, reduce reliance on central transfers, and build more inclusive, 
resilient urban and territorial systems.
Wide gaps remain in public spending for heritage 
preservation   
In the past five years, the number of countries tracking how much they 
spend on protecting cultural and natural heritage has tripled – jumping to 
82 countries. This shows a strong and growing commitment worldwide to 
preserving important sites and traditions. Developing countries have made 
especially big improvements, with Europe and Northern America’s share of 
reporting countries dropping from over two thirds to 40 per cent in just three 
years.
Between 2019 and 2023, the global median public expenditure on cultural 
and natural heritage was $21.22 per person (constant 2017 PPP), with wide 
variation – from under $1 to $367. Developed countries reported a median 
of $83.3 per person, compared to just $3.86 in developing countries, 
highlighting stark investment disparities.

Responsible 
consumption and 
production
• 
Food waste, food loss and electronic waste are reaching unprecedented 
levels, while rising consumption continues to drive increases in domestic 
material consumption and material footprint. These trends are placing 
growing pressure on the environment, accelerating climate change and 
exacerbating global resource inequalities.
• 
However, momentum towards sustainable consumption and production 
is building at the institutional level. Governments are adopting 
supportive policies; companies are expanding sustainability reporting, 
and participation in multilateral environmental agreements is increasing, 
reflecting strong institutional commitment.
• 
More effort is needed to translate the institutional effort into real change 
in global consumption and production levels. Responsible consumption 
and production require a comprehensive transformation across systems, 
policies, markets and behaviours. It demands coordinated efforts across 
governments, the private sector, civil society and consumers at large.
Rising number of countries implement 
sustainability policies and procurement reporting
As of 2024, 530 policies related to sustainable consumption and production 
(SCP) were submitted across 71 countries, a 6 per cent increase from 2023. 
While European and Central Asian nations continue to lead in policy volume, 
new submissions from Bangladesh, the Cook Islands, Kenya and Madagascar 
signal broader regional engagement. However, challenges and barriers 
persist, including a lack of integrated SDG reporting and limited human 
resources to consolidate inputs for submission. Moving forward, efforts must 
focus on scaling up impactful policies, enhancing policy effectiveness and 
translating SCP commitments into tangible environmental and economic 
benefits.
Progress is also evident in sustainable public procurement initiatives. The 
number of reporting countries rose from 40 in 2020 to 67 in 2022 and 
is expected to grow further in 2025. This momentum is supported by 
initiatives like the Global Framework for Action, launched at the twenty-ninth 
United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), which promotes 
sustainable and circular procurement as a driver of demand for near-zero 
emissions and resilient buildings.
Sustainability reporting is now a standard for the 
largest companies
Sustainability reporting has become standard for large companies, with 
reports from 96 per cent of the world’s 250 largest companies by revenue 
and from 79 per cent of the top 100 companies. Driven by mandatory 
reporting and international standards, the number of sustainability 
reports grew nearly fourfold between 2016 and 2023, led by companies in 
Asia, Europe and North America. Since 2016, the finance, insurance and 
manufacturing sectors have led in sustainability reporting. Companies 
most often report on emissions, energy efficiency and CO2 equivalents, 
with a growing emphasis on climate-related disclosures, including carbon 
targets and biodiversity. Governance topics – such as board meetings, audit 
committee independence and gender diversity – are widely covered. Social 
reporting focuses on human rights, health and safety, and diversity policies. 
While setting targets based on the SDGs was once common, recent trends 
in corporate sustainability reports show a slight decline in this approach.
Daily food waste from households could have provided over a billion meals  
Food waste in retail, food service and households reached 1.05 billion metric 
tons in 2022 (132 kilograms per person), representing one fifth of all food 
available to consumers. Households discard enough food daily to provide 
over a billion meals, even as 1 in 11 people worldwide go hungry and 1 in 3 
cannot afford a healthy diet. When combined with the 13 per cent of food 
lost along supply chains, the environmental toll is staggering: food loss and 
waste generated 8–10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, while 
significant amounts of land, water and resources are used to grow food that 
is never eaten. The economic cost is estimated to exceed $1 trillion annually.
Food waste is not just a “rich-country” problem; in high-, upper-middle- and 
lower-middle-income countries, the average household waste differs by 
just 7 kilograms per person per year. Yet progress is possible: the United 
Kingdom and Japan reduced food waste by 18 and 31 per cent, respectively. 
More governments and industries are embracing new solutions and public-
private partnerships to prevent and reduce food waste.
Note: The chart was based on data from 87 high- and middle-income countries. Low-income 
countries are not included due to its much smaller sample size.

Goal 12 | Responsible consumption and production
Despite record levels of e-waste, only a fraction is disposed of responsibly 
In 2022, 96 billion kilograms of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) 
entered the market globally, over 50 per cent more than in 2010. This surge 
has fuelled record levels of electronic waste (e-waste), which reached 62 
billion kilograms (7.8 kilograms per capita) in 2022 and is projected to 
rise to 82 billion kilograms in 2030. Nevertheless, regional disparities are 
significant: per capita e-waste generation in Europe and Northern America 
and in Australia and New Zealand is around 10 times higher than that in 
Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) or sub-Saharan Africa. 
Only 22.3 per cent, or 1.7 kilogram per capita, of generated e-waste 
was documented as having been formally collected and treated in an 
environmentally sound manner in 2022, following a downward trend 
since at least 2010. Significant transboundary movement of e-waste has 
been documented globally, with an estimated 5.1 billion kilograms of used 
EEE and e-waste shipped across borders annually. However, only about 
35 per cent of this trade is classified as “controlled” – those reported as 
movements of hazardous waste with prior informed consent under the Basel 
Convention. The majority of transboundary trade involves “uncontrolled” 
movements, meaning its treatment is unknown and likely not managed 
in an environmentally sound manner. Stronger regulation and investment 
in technology are vital to improving recycling rates, especially for metal 
fractions and critical raw materials, and for ensuring environmentally sound 
management of the world’s fastest-growing waste stream.

Global resource demand surges, outpacing population growth
Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of 
materials directly utilized within an economy, excluding the raw-material 
equivalents of traded products. It accounts for domestic material extraction 
plus the physical balance of material imports and exports. Between 2015 
and 2022, global DMC increased by 23.3 per cent, rising from 92.1 to 113.6 
billion metric tons, while DMC per capita grew by 14.8 per cent, from 12.4 
to 14.2 metric tons per capita. Increasing consumption patterns were the 
primary driver of DMC trends during this period, outweighing the impact 
of population growth. Latin America and the Caribbean saw the highest 
rise, 132 per cent. Non-metallic minerals drove the overall increase, growing 
39.0 per cent, from 43.4 to 60.3 billion metric tons between 2015 and 
2022. Biomass, metal ores and fossil fuels grew by 11.8, 7.4 and 6.2 per cent, 
respectively. 
Material footprint (MF), an indicator representing raw materials extracted 
to meet final consumption demands, exhibited similar overall dynamics 
globally, increasing by 21.3 per cent between 2015 and 2022. Comparison 
of DMC and MF by region shows that DMC is higher than MF in regions 
such as Australia and New Zealand, Central and Southern Asia, and sub-
Saharan Africa; meanwhile, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, and Europe 
and Northern America demonstrate the opposite trend, indicating regional 
inequalities in material distribution and consumption.

Global cooperation enhances transparency on hazardous waste and chemicals
Parties to key multilateral environmental agreements on chemicals 
and wastes continue to demonstrate strong compliance with reporting 
obligations. Under the Minamata Convention, 94 per cent of Parties had 
nominated focal points, and 82 per cent submitted national reports for 
2021–2022. Under the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, all 
Parties had designated at least one national contact point, facilitating the 
required transmission of information. A milestone was reached under the 
Basel Convention, with 70 per cent of Parties submitting reports for 2020 
– the first time a reporting target was met. For the 2023 cycle, 107 Parties 
have already submitted reports. Similarly, the fifth and most recent round of 
reporting under the Stockholm Convention in 2022 saw submissions from 91 
countries. The Montreal Protocol stands out for its consistent 100 per cent 
compliance with reporting obligations, enabling effective monitoring and 
assessment of progress in phasing out ozone-depleting substances.

Climate action
• 
Climate change is accelerating, with 2024 marking the hottest year on 
record, at approximately 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. Extreme 
weather is intensifying, driving the highest climate-related displacement 
in 16 years and worsening food insecurity, economic losses and 
instability. Although one year above 1.5°C does not mean the Paris 
Agreement has been breached, it serves as a clarion call for increasing 
ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade, as current global 
efforts fall far short of what is needed. 
• 
The upcoming global climate summit is a critical opportunity to 
course-correct, by advancing recently agreed climate finance goals, 
strengthening multilateral cooperation and delivering ambitious national 
climate plans across all sectors to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 
Momentum is growing, including a recent global landmark deal on 
shipping emissions with a net-zero pathway and increasing support for 
initiatives such as Early Warnings for All.
• 
The world cannot and must not let up on climate action. To keep the 
1.5°C warming limit within reach, urgent investment in adaptation, 
resilience and emission cuts must accelerate, especially in vulnerable 
regions. The cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of action – and the 
window to secure a liveable, sustainable future is rapidly closing.
Record emissions underscore the urgency of 2025 climate commitments
2025 is a pivotal year for climate action – marking 10 years  since the Paris 
Agreement and the midpoint of a decisive decade for cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions. It is also the deadline for countries to submit updated national 
climate plans or nationally determined contributions (NDCs 3.0), with 
targets for 2035. As of June 2025, only 25 countries had submitted updated 
plans. 
According to the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap 
Report 2024, global greenhouse gas emissions hit a record high of 57.1 
gigatons of CO2 equivalent in 2023, up 1.3 per cent from 2022 and well 
above the 0.8 per cent annual average rise from 2010 to 2019. The power 
sector remains the largest source (26 per cent), followed by transport (15 
per cent), and agriculture and industry (11 per cent each). To stay on track, 
emissions must fall by 7.5 per cent annually until 2035 to limit warming to 
1.5°C or by 4 per cent per year for a 2°C warming limit. Based on current 
climate policies, global temperatures could rise to 3.1°C, with severe impacts 
on people, the planet and economies.

Global subsidies for fossil fuels are still excessive despite drop
Global fossil fuel subsidies fell by 34.5 per cent in 2023 – from a record 
high of $1.68 trillion in 2022 to an estimated $1.10 trillion. This decline was 
driven by falling energy prices and the expiration of temporary COVID-19 
support. All regions except Oceania, which saw a 29 per cent increase, 
reported decreases. Sub-Saharan Africa led with a 67 per cent decline, 
followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia (46 per cent), Latin America 
and the Caribbean (43 per cent), Central and Southern Asia (41 per cent) 
and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (40 per cent). Europe and Northern 
America saw a smaller reduction of 17 per cent. Despite the drop, fossil fuel 
subsidies remain nearly three times 2020 levels and well above historical 
averages. Fossil fuel subsidies are widely recognized as inefficient, distorting 
prices and consumption while diverting public funds from sustainable 
development. They also undermine fiscal stability and climate goals, and 
their limited and inconsistent reporting obscures their true scale. Stronger 
efforts are needed to improve transparency and align fiscal policies with 
climate objectives.

Goal 13 | Climate action
Warming reaches alarming levels as 2024 breaks heat records – yet again
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed a global average 
of 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels in 2024. It was the hottest year in 175 
years, capping a decade of record-breaking temperatures (2015–2024). The 
first half of 2024 alone brought natural hazards that caused devastation 
across every region. However, a single year above 1.5°C does not mean the 
Paris Agreement threshold has been breached. Climate change is measured 
over long-term trends, and current warming is estimated to be between 
1.34°C and 1.41°C above pre-industrial levels.
However, the world is already facing irreversible climate impacts. Glaciers 
are melting at record rates, with many unlikely to survive this century, 
causing short-term hazards and threatening long-term water security. Ocean 
warming has reached record levels and will be locked in for centuries even 
with major emission cuts, driving a rise in sea level and worsening ocean 
acidification. The WMO estimates an 80 per cent chance that at least one of 
the next five years will surpass 2024 as the hottest on record. Every fraction 
of a degree of additional warming drives more frequent and more intense 
extreme weather.

(USA), Berkeley Earth (USA), ERA5 (ECMWF) and JRA-55 (Japan).
Global disaster deaths have nearly halved, but vulnerability and impacts are surging
Disaster risk continues to grow, driven by more intense hazards and 
development patterns that leave communities increasingly exposed and 
vulnerable. Reported direct economic losses now average $202 billion a 
year, but when cascading effects and ecosystem damage are included, the 
total exceeds $2.3 trillion. These rising costs deepen debt, reduce income, 
increase uninsurability and heighten reliance on humanitarian aid. Extreme 
heat has emerged as a major threat, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms 
and droughts – the five disaster types responsible for nearly all recorded 
direct losses over the past two decades. Moreover, no country is exempt. 
While climate change is intensifying hazards, investments in reducing 
exposure and vulnerability are effective. Between 2014 and 2023, disaster-
related mortality (excluding COVID-19) nearly halved to 0.79 per 100,000 
people, down from 1.61 in the previous decade. Annual deaths dropped by 
36 per cent to 41,647 compared to 2005–2014 levels. However, the number 
of people affected by disasters has surged. The rate of affected populations 
rose by 75 per cent to 2,028 per 100,000, with an average of 124 million 
people impacted each year. This reflects growing vulnerability and exposure, 
even as fewer lives are lost. Countries in special situations, such as LDCs, 
SIDS and LLDCs, suffer disaster impacts at more than twice the global 
average. LDCs alone account for 26 per cent of global disaster deaths 
despite representing just 12 per cent of the population. 
Disaster risk reduction strategies and early-warning systems are key to 
reducing losses. As of October 2024, 131 countries reported having national 
disaster risk strategies, up from 57 in 2015, and 113 reported having multi-
hazard early-warning systems. Countries with more comprehensive early-
warning systems report six to eight times fewer disaster-related deaths and 
up to five times fewer people affected. Sustained support for early-warning 
systems, infrastructure resilience and international cooperation is essential 
for protecting lives, reducing economic losses and building lasting resilience.
Mainstreaming climate change concepts in education is still a work in progress
Mainstreaming sustainable development and climate change into school 
curricula is part of national commitments in the SDGs and Paris Agreement. 
A recent analysis of nearly 1,700 curriculum frameworks and science and 
social science syllabuses for grades 3, 6 and 9 across 110 countries assessed 
green content under three themes: environment/sustainability, climate 
change and biodiversity. Findings show these themes appear more often 
in syllabuses than in frameworks, more in science than social science and 
more in higher grades. For example, in social science subjects, 27 per cent 
of countries had no green content in grade 3 syllabuses, compared to 16 per 
cent in grade 9. In science syllabuses, the share of countries without green 
content dropped from 23 per cent in grade 3 to just 8 per cent in grade 9.
A 0–100 index was developed to help countries assess and improve efforts 
towards green education. The average score was 40, with higher scores for 
environment/sustainability (55) and lower for climate change (21). Only one 
quarter of countries met the suggested benchmark of 50. Notably, greener 
curricula were not consistently found in wealthier or more climate-vulnerable 
countries, suggesting that meaningful integration of green content is possible 
across diverse national contexts.

Life below water
• 
Oceans and seas are vital to life on Earth, regulating climate, sustaining 
biodiversity, supporting livelihoods and food security, enabling global 
trade and providing countless ecosystem services. Yet they face 
mounting threats from overfishing, pollution, biodiversity loss and 
climate change.
• 
Despite growing conservation efforts, only 8.4 per cent of the ocean is 
classified as marine protected areas, far short of the target of 30 per cent 
by 2030, and just 46 per cent of marine key biodiversity areas are under 
protection. Ocean warming and acidification continue, overfishing and 
illegal practices persist, and support for small-scale fisheries remains 
insufficient.
• 
Ocean recovery is possible through sustainable ocean stewardship that 
combines strong fisheries management, ecosystem-based approaches, 
“blue finance” and ambitious, strategic conservation. But this requires 
scaled-up investment, global cooperation and innovative partnerships 
across all levels of society.
• 
The third United Nations Ocean Conference, held in Nice in June 
2025, offered renewed momentum. Countries adopted a bold political 
declaration and made over 800 voluntary commitments focused on 
marine protection, pollution control, high-seas governance and support 
for vulnerable nations. A key milestone was progress towards the 
Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National 
Jurisdiction (the BBNJ Agreement), with 19 new ratifications bringing 
the total to 50 States – just 10 States short of the 60 needed for the 
Agreement to enter into force.
Sustainability challenges persist, but new data show effective management drives progress
New global estimates based on expanded stock assessments reveal that 
64.5 per cent of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically sustainable 
levels in 2021, while 35.5 per cent were overfished. This marks a modest 
improvement from previous estimates of 62.3 per cent for sustainably fished 
stocks. However, the share of overfished stocks continues to grow by about 
1 per cent annually, highlighting the urgent need for more effective fisheries 
management. When considering catch volume, 77.2 per cent of global 
landings came from sustainably fished stocks, suggesting that high-yield 
fisheries tend to be better managed. 
Regional variations are substantial. Well-managed areas, such as the 
Northeast and Southwest Pacific, showed high rates of sustainable fish 
stocks, at 92.7 and 85.5 per cent respectively, well above the global average. 
In contrast, the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Southeastern Pacific face 
significant sustainability challenges despite recent progress.
Tuna fisheries exemplify successful management, with nearly all landings 
coming from sustainably managed stocks due to robust management efforts 
and regional cooperation. The findings demonstrate that effective and 
consistent fisheries management is key to reversing overfishing and securing 
sustainable fish stocks for the future.
Oceans reach record heat as coral bleaching crisis continues to unfold
The ocean absorbs around 90 per cent of the excess heat trapped by 
greenhouse gases, making it the planet’s largest heat reservoir. WMO 
confirms that in 2024, ocean heat content reached the highest level in 65 
years of observations, continuing an eight-year streak of record-setting 
warming. Since 2005, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled and 
is expected to continue rising throughout the century, even under future low-
emissions scenarios. Sea-surface temperatures have also hit record highs 
across vast regions, including the tropical and North Atlantic, tropical Indian 
Ocean, and parts of the western Pacific and Southern Oceans.
This warming is driving widespread and often irreversible marine ecosystem 
degradation. Coral reefs, home to a quarter of marine life and supporting 
approximately a billion people worldwide, are under severe stress. Rising 
ocean temperature caused by climate change is the primary cause of 
coral bleaching. The world is now in the midst of a fourth global coral 
bleaching event, which is considered the most widespread and intense on 
record. Between January 2023 and May 2025, bleaching-level heat stress 
affected 84 per cent of reefs globally, across 83 countries and territories. 
The bleaching event is so severe that coral mortality alert levels have been 
expanded beyond their original scale.
Repeated bleaching events and shrinking recovery periods are accelerating 
coral decline. From 2009 to 2018, 14 per cent of the globe’s coral cover was 
lost. Now 44 per cent of coral species face extinction. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change warns that even if global warming is limited to 
1.5°C, 70 to 90 per cent of warm-water reefs could vanish by 2050. At a 2°C 
warming limit, nearly all reefs would disappear, threatening biodiversity, food 
security and climate resilience.

Goal 14 | Life below water
Ocean acidification is a rising global threat with diverse regional and local consequences 
The ocean absorbs around a quarter of human-caused CO2 emissions 
annually; while this helps to regulate the Earth’s climate, it results in 
acidification of ocean waters, threatening marine ecosystems and coral reefs, 
weakening coastal protection and food security, and limiting the ocean’s 
future carbon uptake. Ocean pH has steadily declined across all ocean 
basins and seas. According to WMO, the average ocean pH has decreased 
from 8.1 in 1985 to 8.04 in 2023 (or -0.017 pH units per decade). Regional 
hotspots, such as the Indian, Southern and eastern equatorial Pacific Oceans, 
are becoming acidified more quickly than the global average, while coastal 
areas show greater variability due to freshwater run-off, ice melt and nutrient 
pollution.
Monitoring efforts are expanding rapidly, with the number of observation 
stations increasing from 178 in 2021 to 765 in 2025. Still, significant data 
gaps remain, especially in coastal Asia, Africa and open-ocean regions; 
this limits impact modelling and ecosystem vulnerability assessments. As 
acidification continues to intensify, expanding monitoring, particularly in 
undersampled coastal regions, is critical for understanding its impacts and 
informing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies.

From treaties to tools, countries intensify response to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing remains a major threat to 
the sustainability of the world’s fisheries, undermining marine ecosystems, 
food security and economies. IUU fishing accounts for up to 26 million 
metric tons of fish annually – about 15 per cent of global catches – and 
disproportionately harms small-scale fishers in coastal communities, 
reduces food availability and deepens poverty. It is also often linked to other 
illicit activities, including organized crime and forced labour.
Despite these challenges, countries are making measurable progress. Between 
2018 and 2024, global implementation of key international instruments to 
combat IUU fishing improved from a medium to high rating (from 3 to 4 on a 
scale of 1 to 5). The share of highest-scoring (level 5) countries grew from 48 
to 56 per cent. SIDS and LDCs, often challenged by vast maritime zones or 
limited resources, reached an average score of 4 by 2024.
Key instruments are driving this progress, including the Agreement on Port 
State Measures (PSMA), the first binding global treaty to specifically target 
IUU fishing. Now with 83 Parties, this Agreement covers 109 States. Other 
tools include voluntary guidelines on transshipment and the PSMA Global 
Information Exchange System, which enables vessel compliance data-
sharing. Additionally, as of June 2025, the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
of the World Trade Organization has been ratified by 102 members – just 
9 short of entering it into force. While progress is encouraging, sustained 
global cooperation and full implementation of international instruments and 
tools are essential to close the net on the harmful impacts of IUU fishing.
States are moving beyond policy formulation and into implementation of integrated ocean management
With ocean ecosystems increasingly threatened by climate change, pollution 
and habitat loss, sustainable ocean management has become essential. 
Countries are advancing ecosystem-based approaches, such as marine 
spatial planning (MSP) and integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), 
which link terrestrial and marine policies to build resilience, reduce conflicts 
and optimize the use of ocean space. MSP supports inclusive, transparent 
decision-making and is evolving to better integrate climate change and 
biodiversity considerations, from habitat protection to sustainable blue-
economy planning.
In 2023, 126 countries and territories were engaged in MSP initiatives, a 
20 per cent increase from 2022, with significant progress in Africa and 
Oceania. However, only 45 countries have formally approved marine spatial 
plans, underscoring the need for more capacity-building and stronger policy 
integration. Since 2015, efforts have shifted from policy formulation to 
implementation, with Europe and Northern America advancing adaptive 
management, while many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America 
remain in the early planning stages. 
Key challenges persist, especially in developing regions; these include data 
gaps, limited institutional coordination and insufficient financing. To achieve 
healthy and productive oceans, stronger commitment, cross-sectoral 
integration and adaptive governance are needed. Scaling up ICZM and 
MSP will help secure the long-term future of marine ecosystems and the 
communities that depend on them.

Life on land
• 
 Persistent challenges continue to hinder progress in protecting life 
on land, managing natural resources sustainably and combating the 
biodiversity crisis. Global forest cover is shrinking; protection of key 
biodiversity areas (KBAs) has stalled recently, and species extinction is 
accelerating. 
• 
Yet, there are signs of progress: global forest loss is slowing, and regional 
advances show promise. Voluntary land restoration commitments would 
cover two thirds of what is needed. Conservation of KBAs has steadily 
increased over two decades through successful global site-level efforts. 
Biodiversity-related official development finance has also shown a 
positive trend.  
• 
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework has renewed 
global attention to the biodiversity crisis, creating opportunities to 
strengthen efforts to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity, enhance 
benefit-sharing frameworks, and develop and improve ecosystem and 
biodiversity accounting. With growing momentum, it offers a critical 
chance to accelerate action and close remaining gaps to protect vital 
terrestrial ecosystems.
Shifting forest trends show progress and setbacks to halt deforestation
Forests covered about 4.1 billion hectares (31 per cent) of the world’s land 
surface in 2020. From 2000 to 2020, forest coverage shrank by about 
100 million hectares. While afforestation, forest restoration and natural 
forest expansion led to some gains, losses from deforestation dominate; 
agricultural expansion was the main driving force, accounting for nearly 
90 per cent of forest loss. Regional trends vary: Asia, Europe and Northern 
America saw forest growth, while Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa 
experienced significant losses, driven by livestock grazing and cropland 
expansion, respectively.  
Deforestation is slowing, with the rate falling from 12 million hectares per 
year (2010–2015) to 10 million (2015–2020). While this is progress, at 
the current rate, halting deforestation, as called for in Goal 15, would take 
another 25 years. Recent data show notable progress in certain countries. 
Indonesia reduced deforestation by 14 per cent in 2021–2022 compared to 
2020–2021. Brazil cut deforestation in the Legal Amazon by 50 per cent in 
2023 compared to 2022. There are also signs that deforestation is slowing 
across the African continent.
Forests face mounting climate pressures, with intensifying wildfires and 
invasive species. Wildfires emitted an estimated 6,687 metric megatons of 
CO2
 globally in 2023, more than double the emissions from fossil fuels by the 
European Union. Meanwhile, global wood production has reached a record 
high of 4 billion cubic metres annually, while nearly 6 billion people depend 
on non-timber forest products. Global roundwood demand could rise by 49 
per cent by 2050.

Significant investments in restoration are needed to achieve land degradation neutrality
Land degradation extends beyond environmental harm, undermining human 
health, driving poverty, worsening food insecurity and fuelling migration. 
Each year at least 100 million hectares of land (the size of Egypt) become 
degraded. Between 2015 and 2019, the global proportion of degraded land 
increased from 11.3 to 15.5 per cent, undermining the well-being of 3.2 billion 
people. Achieving a land-degradation-neutral world by 2030 requires the 
restoration of approximately 1.5 billion hectares. 
While voluntary commitments have pledged to restore over 1 billion hectares 
of land, with large-scale restoration initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa, 
Central America, Central Asia and the Middle East, restoration efforts 
on the ground are advancing too slowly. Investments in land restoration 
deliver substantial returns, with each dollar invested yielding $7 to $30 
in benefits. Yet, financing is insufficient. According to the United Nations 
Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), combating desertification, 
land degradation and drought demands $1 billion per day between 2025 
and 2030. But current annual funding stands at $66 billion, just 18 per 
cent of estimated needs. Without a significant scale-up in financing and 
implementation, losses in productivity, resilience and biodiversity will 
continue to mount.

All major species groups are in decline on the Red List Index
Species extinction is irreversible, resulting in the permanent loss of 
biodiversity and threatening humanity’s well-being. Over 47,000 species 
are threatened with extinction, with all major species groups on the Red 
List Index in decline – especially corals, amphibians and cycads. Since 
1993, the Index has deteriorated by 12 per cent, with sharpest declines in 
Southern Asia and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, while the least severe 
are in Northern America and Central Asia. These regional differences reflect 
differences in consumption patterns, governance capacity, conservation 
funding and the vulnerability of tropical species with small range sizes.
New assessments show rising threats to freshwater species, including fish, 
dragonflies, crabs and shrimps – one in four now threatened by pollution, 
dams, agriculture, invasive species and overharvesting. Trees are also at 
risk: 38 per cent of the assessed 47,282 species face extinction as a result 
of habitat loss, overexploitation, climate change, pests and diseases. 
This impacts entire ecosystems and human livelihoods. Encouragingly, 
site conservation and restoration, invasive species response and ex situ 
conservation are proving effective. Scaling up such efforts is vital to halt and 
reverse biodiversity loss and prevent ecosystem collapse.

Average protection of KBAs has nearly doubled, but most remain at risk
Since 2000, significant progress has been made in biodiversity conservation 
through protected and conserved areas. SDG target 15.1 was achieved by 
2020, with 17.6 per cent of terrestrial and inland areas now under protection. 
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework now calls for 30 
per cent coverage by 2030. Safeguarding KBAs – sites vital for species and 
ecosystems – is among the most impactful conservation approaches. While 
68 per cent of KBAs are partially or fully within protected and conserved 
areas, the global average has plateaued, rising from 25 to 44 per cent since 
2000 but showing limited progress after 2015. 
Real-world successes offer hope: Mozambique’s Chimanimani National 
Park, designated in 2020, safeguards many threatened amphibian and plant 
species; Redonda Island (Antigua and Barbuda) has been restored and 
has 30,000 hectares protected following the removal of invasive species; 
Canada’s coastal First Nations communities lead KBA monitoring; and over 
3 million trees have been planted in restoring Madagascar’s Kianjavato 
Classified Forest KBA. These efforts highlight what is possible – and 
exemplify the ambition required to meet global targets.

Upward trend observed in biodiversity-related official development finance
Total development finance for biodiversity from various sources rose from 
$9.5 billion in 2015 to $11.9 billion in 2023, marking a 25 per cent increase. 
ODA accounted for an average of 97 per cent of total flows over this period. 
Despite rising biodiversity finance, flows targeting biodiversity as a principal 
objective declined by 17 per cent, from $4.6 billion in 2015 to $3.8 billion in 
2023. Biodiversity represents a relatively small share of total development 
finance – just 7 per cent. Private finance for biodiversity has more than 
doubled, from $748 million in 2021 to $1.8 billion in 2022, with preliminary 
2023 figures approaching $4 billion. Still, this remains modest compared 
to areas like climate change, which averaged $16.1 billion annually between 
2017 and 2022. Meeting the Global Biodiversity Framework’s financing 
targets will require greater mobilization of both private and public flows.

Peace, justice and 
strong institutions
• 
Violence and conflict continue to drive human suffering and 
displacement. In 2024, nearly 50,000 lives were lost to conflict – one 
every 12 minutes – disproportionately affecting women and children. 
By the end of 2024, 123.2 million people were forcibly displaced. While 
global homicide rates fell by 12 per cent between 2015 and 2023, 
progress remains far below the 50 per cent reduction target.
• 
Access to justice remains elusive: one in three prisoners worldwide are 
held without a proper sentence, and risks to human rights defenders and 
journalists persist. The number of journalist killings rose by 11 per cent in 
2024, with conflict zones especially dangerous.
• 
There are signs of progress: budget reliability has improved, access-to-
information laws expanded, and more countries now have compliant 
human rights institutions. Still, significant gaps remain in building 
effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. 
• 
Urgent action is needed to protect lives and restore trust through 
peacebuilding, justice reform and accountability. This requires 
strengthening institutions, promoting inclusive governance, protecting 
civic space and addressing root causes of conflict and injustice. 
Sustained political will and enhanced international cooperation are 
essential to drive lasting change.
The global homicide rate is declining, but reductions are insufficient to meet the 2030 target
The global intentional homicide rate declined from 5.9 per 100,000 people 
in 2015 to 5.2 in 2023. If current trends continue, the rate will decrease by 
25 per cent between 2015 and 2030 – falling short of the 50 per cent SDG 
target. In 2023, homicides were heavily concentrated in Latin America and 
the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa, which together accounted for 
nearly two thirds of all victims worldwide. Men made up 80 per cent of 
homicide victims, largely due to organized crime and gang violence. Women, 
however, faced a disproportionate risk within the home, with 60 per cent of 
female victims killed by partners or family members. In 2023 alone, about 
51,000 women were killed by intimate partners or family members. Progress 
in reducing violence against women continues to lag, with the female 
homicide rate declining by just 5 per cent compared to the 14 per cent 
reduction for men.

Loss of lives amid armed conflicts surged 40 per cent in 2024; casualties among children and women 
quadrupled in just two years
In 2024, at least one life was lost every 12 minutes due to armed conflict, 
totalling 48,384 conflict-related deaths, mostly civilians. This represents 
a 40 per cent increase from 2023 and marks the third consecutive annual 
rise. About four times more children (337 per cent) and women (258 per 
cent) were killed in 2023–2024 than in the previous biennium. Of these, 
8 in 10 child deaths and 7 in 10 female deaths occurred in Gaza. Explosive 
weapons were the primary cause of lethal violence in several regions, while 
unexploded ordnance continued to threaten lives in Central and Southern 
Asia. Nearly 30 per cent of victims’ status remain undetermined. These 
distressing figures reveal a stark deviation from the trajectory towards global 
peace, security and sustainable development. Immediate and concerted 
efforts are imperative to reverse this trend and to adhere to international 
humanitarian and human rights law.

Goal 16 | Peace, justice and strong institutions
Strengthening institutions for inclusive governance shows progress, but deep gaps remain for trust, 
transparency and service delivery
Building effective, accountable and transparent institutions requires 
reliable fiscal management, accessible information systems and responsive 
governance structures that foster public trust and civic engagement. 
While significant progress has been achieved in the following areas, critical 
challenges persist:  
• 
Reliable budgets are key to fiscal discipline, effective resource use and 
accountable institutions. As countries recover from the pandemic, 
global budget deviations improved from 12.6 per cent in 2020 to 9.6 per 
cent in 2023. However, low- and lower-middle-income countries still 
experienced higher volatility. From 2015 to 2023, budget deviations in 
low-income countries exceeded 15 per cent three times, peaking at 22.4 
per cent in 2020. Upper-middle- and high-income countries showed 
greater stability. 
• 
Access to information empowers citizens to hold governments 
accountable. By 2024, 140 countries had adopted access-to-information 
laws, up from just 14 in 1990. A 2024 survey found that 95 per cent of 
125 countries have legal guarantees, but enforcement remains uneven. 
Countries with dedicated oversight bodies scored 7.5 out of 9 on 
compliance, compared to 3.7 for countries without them. Yet only 35 
per cent of these bodies can mediate disputes, limiting opportunities to 
resolve conflicts efficiently and avoid burdensome legal processes.
• 
By 2024, 89 countries had fully compliant independent national human 
rights institutions (status A) – up from 70 in 2015 – serving 55 per cent 
of the global population. An additional 25 countries had institutions 
partially compliant with the Paris Principles (status B). 
• 
Public service delivery shapes the population’s trust in government, with 
satisfaction levels revealing critical gaps across sectors and regions. 
Globally, administrative services receive the highest satisfaction rating 
at 64 per cent, followed by education at 58 per cent and healthcare 
at 57 per cent; however, healthcare shows the widest variation across 
countries (9–93 per cent). 
• 
Trust in governance remains fragile, with many feeling politically 
unheard. Data from 83 countries show only 44 per cent of people believe 
their political systems are responsive and their voices matter in decision-
making outcomes. Counter-intuitively, wealthier countries show lower 
political efficacy. Women report lower political voice than men. Restoring 
responsive and inclusive governance is critical to revitalizing civic trust 
and engagement.
Detected trafficking victims rise sharply, with children increasingly targeted
Globally, detected human trafficking victims increased by 25 per cent in 
2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels and by 43 per cent compared to 
2020. A key driver of this surge is the growing number of child victims, 
which has risen by 31 per cent since 2019. Children accounted for 38 per 
cent of all detected trafficking victims globally in 2022 – up sharply from 
13 per cent in 2004. Girls are primarily trafficked for sexual exploitation 
(60 per cent), while boys are mainly exploited for forced labour (45 per 
cent) and other purposes such as forced criminality and begging (47 per 
cent). Regionally, Europe and Northern America detect more adult victims, 
whereas Central America, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and Northern 
Africa record the highest shares of child victims, with children accounting for 
around 60 per cent of those detected.

Human rights defenders and journalists face 
alarming levels of violence in 2024
Killings and disappearances of human rights defenders, journalists and 
trade unionists remained alarmingly high in 2024, with at least 502 killings 
documented across 44 countries and 123 disappearances documented 
across 37 countries. While these represent slight declines from 2023, 
persistent human rights abuses continue to undermine progress towards 
peace, justice and accountability. Conflict remains a key driver: Northern 
Africa and Western Asia saw a 24 per cent rise in killings, while sub-Saharan 
Africa recorded a 32 per cent increase in disappearances.
Journalist killings increased 11 per cent to 82 deaths, with over 60 per cent 
in conflict zones – the highest share in over a decade. Northern Africa and 
Western Asia continues to be the most fatal region for journalists, while 
Latin America and the Caribbean remains the deadliest region for human 
rights defenders. Detentions of defenders also surged, with at least 31 
countries recording at least 10 new cases in 2024, especially concentrated in 
Central and Southern Asia and in Northern Africa and Western Asia. 
One in three prisoners are held without proper 
sentencing as the global inmate count grows
Access to justice is a fundamental human right, yet progress in reducing 
unsentenced detention has stalled. In 2023, 3.7 million people – 31 per 
cent of the global prison population of 11.7 million – were held in pretrial 
detention, a slight increase from 29 per cent in 2015. While some regions 
have improved, others have seen setbacks. In Latin America and the 
Caribbean, the share of unsentenced detainees fell from 41 to 30 per cent 
between 2015 and 2023. In contrast, Oceania saw an increase from 27 to 37 
per cent, and in Central and Southern Asia, the share rose from 50 to 60  
per cent.
Of those in pretrial detention in 2023, 94 per cent were men and 6 per cent 
were women. Globally, the unsentenced detention rate was 32 per cent for 
men and 30 per cent for women. However, regional differences persist. In 
sub-Saharan Africa, 50 per cent of incarcerated women versus 41 per cent 
of men were held without a proper sentence. Addressing these disparities is 
critical for upholding justice and human rights.

• 
 Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced record-high $1.4 
trillion debt-servicing costs in 2023, compounded by a $4 trillion annual 
investment gap that severely constrained SDG achievement. Despite 
increased financial flows from official and private sources, ODA declined 
by 7.1 per cent after five years of growth, with further cuts expected 
through 2025.
• 
The share of developing countries in global merchandise exports has 
remained stagnant since 2015, with LDCs accounting for just 1.1 per cent 
– far below the SDG target to double their share by 2020.
• 
Access to information and communications technology continues to 
expand, but the digital divide remains wide, especially in lower-income 
regions. While data systems and national statistical capacities have 
improved, many countries still lack sustainable financing to support the 
data infrastructure and production needed to meet growing demands.
• 
Accelerating progress requires renewed international cooperation to 
bridge the investment gap, innovative financing to reduce debt burdens, 
targeted digital infrastructure support and strengthened statistical 
capacity for better SDG tracking and implementation.
Debt service costs for low- and middle-income countries hit a record $1.4 trillion
The total debt servicing costs (principal plus interest payments) for all 
LMICs reached a record of $1.4 trillion in 2023. The increase in total debt 
service payments is a direct outcome of the rapid accumulation of external 
debt over the past decade, interest rates that hit a two-decade high and 
depreciation of local currencies against a strong United States dollar. This 
significantly exceeds pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, LMICs spent 3.7 per cent 
of their gross national income (GNI) to service their debt, straining already 
limited resources and leaving less room for investments in health, education 
and infrastructure. 
Principal repayments rose nearly 1 per cent to $950.9 billion, while interest 
payments surged 37.1 per cent to $405.3 billion – both at all-time highs. 
Consequently, the debt-service-to-exports ratio deteriorated by 1.6 
percentage points to 14.7 per cent for LMICs in 2023. The ratio of debt 
service on public and publicly guaranteed debt to export earnings increased 
to 4.4 per cent in 2023, after a two-year decline to 4.3 per cent in 2022.

Trade can drive sustainable development when participation is equitable in 
global markets. After steady increases in the early 2000s and 2010s, the 
share of merchandise exports from developing regions has stagnated since 
2015. For 2023’s global exports, the share of Europe and Northern America 
was nearly half, and that of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia made up almost 
a third. The contributions of other regions remained low, between 1.7 and 7.5 
per cent. SIDS saw their share decline slightly from 2.4 per cent in 2015 to 
2.3 per cent in 2023. LLDCs and LDCs showed minimal gains, each reaching 
only 1.2 and 1.1 per cent, respectively. This is markedly off the SDG target 
to significantly increase the exports of developing countries and double 
the export share of LDCs by 2020. Both LLDCs and LDCs have maintained 
negative trade balances since 2015.
Unlike merchandise exports, developing regions have struggled to expand 
their share of global services trade. In 2023, developed regions dominated 
service exports at 70 per cent, while developing regions contributed 30 per 
cent, with developing Asia making up the largest share at 25 per cent.

Goal 17 | Partnerships for the Goals
Official development assistance falls in 2024 after 
five years of consecutive growth
In 2024, ODA by member countries of the Development Assistance 
Committee (DAC) amounted to $212.1 billion on a grant equivalent basis, 
representing 0.33 per cent of the DAC members’ combined GNI. This 
marked a 7.1 per cent decline in real terms from 2023, marking the first drop 
after five years of consecutive growth. The decrease was driven by reduced 
contributions to international organizations, lower aid for Ukraine, decreased 
humanitarian aid and reduced spending on hosting refugees in donor 
countries. Net ODA flows reached $209.8 billion in 2024, representing a 9.3 
per cent decline in real terms from 2023.
Between 2019 and 2023, ODA increased by 33 per cent in real terms 
as most DAC members expanded their aid budgets to help developing 
countries address consecutive global crises – the COVID-19 pandemic and 
Russia’s war against Ukraine. Despite the 2024 decline, ODA remained 23 
per cent above 2019 levels. However, the downward trend is expected to 
continue. A recent survey and available information show that ODA could 
fall an additional 9–17 per cent from 2024 to 2025, as several donors have 
announced ODA budget cuts. 
Development finance flows increased across 
multiple sources 
In 2023, financial resources for developing countries from 106 bilateral and 
multilateral providers totalled $303 billion in official resources and $58.7 
billion in mobilized private finance. All financing forms have increased since 
2019 ($205.9 billion official, $46.7 billion private), with concessional loans 
showing the largest growth at 77 per cent.
Global foreign direct investment (FDI) reached an estimated $1.4 trillion in 
2024, up 11 per cent from 2023, though falling 8 per cent when excluding 
flows through European conduit economies. SDG-related investments 
declined 11 per cent in 2024. While renewable energy, health and education 
sectors saw gains, three critical areas – infrastructure, agrifood systems, and 
water and sanitation – now receive less international financing than in 2015.
Global remittance flows totalled $861 billion in 2023, a 3 per cent increase 
from 2022. Flows to LMICs grew 1.4 per cent to reach $647 billion, slowing 
from an average 10 per cent growth in 2021–2022. The actual size of 
remittance flows is likely larger when including informal channels. The 
moderation reflects normalization after post-pandemic increases, supported 
by strong labour markets in advanced economies. 
Internet use continues to grow, but universal connectivity remains a distant prospect
In 2024, 5.5 billion people were online, representing 68 per cent of the world 
population. However, one third of the global population (2.6 billion) remain 
offline. While global Internet use has grown from 40 per cent in 2015 to 68 
per cent in 2024 (equal to an annual average growth rate of 6.1 per cent), 
universal usage  –  95 per cent penetration – remains a distant prospect. 
Internet use remains tightly linked to the level of development. Universal use 
has been achieved or nearly achieved in Australia and New Zealand, as well 
as Europe and Northern America, while sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania 
(excluding Australia and New Zealand) are lagging, with only 37 and 33 per 
cent of people online, respectively. Among LDCs and LLDCs, Internet use 
stands at just 35 and 39 per cent, respectively. Globally, 70 per cent of men 
were online, compared with 65 per cent of women, leaving 189 million more 
men than women connected in 2024. This difference has been decreasing 
since 2021, when it stood at 277 million.

Statistical capacity improves, but sustainable investment is needed across all countries 
High-quality, timely and disaggregated data are vital for SDG progress. 
Despite COVID-19 disruptions, national statistical systems have 
strengthened. The average Open Data Inventory (ODIN) score increased 
sharply from 2022 to 2024 across all regions; for the first time, the global 
score surpassed 50 out of 100. Economic and environmental data saw 
the strongest gains, while social and demographic data lagged. Even in 
developed countries, the average ODIN score is only 60, highlighting the 
urgent need for increased investment in data infrastructure and production 
across all countries. Similarly, Statistical Performance Indicator (SPI) scores 
rose from 58.6 in 2016 to 69.7 in 2023, owing to the heightened demand for 
reliable data during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, progress has stalled 
in several regions, and low-income countries continue to lag due to limited 
resources and capacity. 
In 2024, 159 countries and territories reported having national statistical 
legislation in compliance with the Fundamental Principles of Official 
Statistics, up from 132 countries in 2019, and 137 countries reported 
implementing a national statistical plan, though only 95 were fully funded. 
Sustainable financing remains a key challenge for addressing evolving data 
needs.

Note to the reader
Regional groupings
This report presents data on progress made towards achieving the SDGs 
worldwide and by various groups. The country groupings are based on 
the geographic regions defined in the Standard Country or Area Codes for 
Statistical Use (known as M49)  of the United Nations Statistics Division. 
The geographic regions are shown on the map to the right. For the purpose 
of presentation, some of the M49 regions have been combined. 
The use of geographic regions as the basis for country groupings is a major 
change from The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2016 and the progress 
reports on the Millennium Development Goals. Previously, data were 
presented for countries in “developed” and “developing” regions, which 
were further broken down into geographic subregions. Although there is no 
established convention for the designation of “developed” and “developing” 
countries or areas in the United Nations system, data for some indicators 
in this report are still being presented for developed and developing regions 
and countries for the purpose of statistical analysis only, and are based on 
the practice employed by the international agencies that provided the data. 
The text and figures present, to the extent possible, data for least developed 
countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing 
States, which are country groups requiring special attention.
A complete list of countries included in each region and subregion and 
country group is available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/
regional-groups/.
The term “country” used in this report also refers, as appropriate, to 
territories and areas. The designations employed and the presentation of the 
material in this report do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever 
on the part of the United Nations Secretariat concerning the legal status 
of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the 
delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. 
Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals
The information presented in this report is based on the latest available data 
(as of June 2025) on selected indicators in the global indicator framework1  
for the Sustainable Development Goals. The global indicator framework is 
used to review progress at the global level and was developed by the Inter-
Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by 
the General Assembly on 6 July 2017 (see resolution 71/313, annex).  
The choice of indicators used in the report does not represent a prioritization 
of targets, since all goals and targets are equally important. The “SDG 
Extended Report 2025”, available online2, includes additional analysis, full 
references and expanded stories from custodian agencies that could not be 
included in the report due to space limitations. 
Data sources
The values for most of the indicators presented in the report are regional 
and/or subregional aggregates. In general, the figures are weighted averages, 
using the reference population as a weight, of national data produced by 
national statistical systems and calculated by international agencies with 
specialized mandates. The national data are often adjusted for comparability 
and, where lacking, are estimated. As decided by the Statistical Commission 
and in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 2006/6, 
estimates used to compile the global indicators should be produced in 
full consultation with national statistical authorities. The criteria and 
mechanisms for validation by national statistical authorities are outlined 
in the report of the IAEG-SDGs3 and were endorsed by the Statistical 
Commission at its fiftieth session.4 
Although the aggregate figures presented here are a convenient way to track 
progress, the situation of individual countries within a given region – and 
across population groups and geographical areas within a country – may 
vary significantly from regional averages. Presenting aggregate figures for all 
regions also obscures another reality: the lack, in many parts of the world, 
of adequate data to assess national trends and to inform and monitor the 
implementation of development policies. 
A database of available global, regional and country data as well as metadata 
for the SDG indicators is maintained by the United Nations Statistics 
Division at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs. Owing to the emergence of new data 
and revised methodologies, data series presented in this report may not be 
comparable with previous data series.
