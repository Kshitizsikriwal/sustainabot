Working Paper 213 - Gender in Water and Sanitation Provision and Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Ghana  
Summary 
This study assessed the pressures, drivers and responses 
to the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Ghana in terms 
of gendered demand and consumption of water and 
sanitation. The research question was how the COVID-19 
outbreak has affected water demand and sanitation, 
with a special focus on social inclusion and gender. 
Data collection was conducted through a household 
questionnaire survey of 146 households in Ga South 
District in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. The 
study area was selected as a rural area within the Greater 
Accra Metropolitan Area. A complementary qualitative 
study was conducted by a male and a female facilitation 
team using Focus Group Discussions disaggregated by 
women, men, youths and mixed groups. Key informant 
interviews were also conducted with both male and 
female respondents. 
The main findings of the study are as follows: 
COVID-19 impacts are gendered. Women, men, youths 
and children are differentially affected by COVID-19 
within the study site. For instance, women and girls have 
a greater burden of collecting additional water, school-
going children are deprived of their education and men 
are staying at home, increasing the risk of domestic 
violence. Government statistics noted that there was a 
7% increase in domestic violence in areas placed under 
lockdown. School-going girl children were at a greater risk 
of pregnancy in light of increased teenage pregnancy rates 
in Ghana during COVID-19. Youths without employment 
or schooling opportunities in the COVID-19 period also 
experimented with alcohol due to the myth that it kills the 
COVID-19 virus. 
Government's Free Water Initiative response has further 
marginalized rural citizens. The government of Ghana 
has rightly intervened with a Free Water Initiative as a 
mechanism to facilitate free access to water and avoid 
the risk of spreading COVID-19 within urban areas. Rural 
areas did not benefit from such government support. Rural 
households continued to pay the volume-based charges 
collected by the Water User Committee which uses the 
funds as a fund for repairing the boreholes when they 
break down. As a result, the initiative did not benefit the 
urban poor as well as rural households. 
Women and girls' water collection burden has been 
worsened. COVID-19 entailed a requirement for increased 
use of water for handwashing and other hygienic purposes. 
Across all households, water points were away from the 
household compounds. Women and girls were spending 
more time collecting water for domestic uses beyond their 
compound. Childcare roles also increased, especially 
when schools were closed. The limited housing space 
and low levels of education for most rural parents made 
homeschooling even more difficult. Children-specific 
participatory studies led by a rapporteur on children's rights 
showed how low-income neighborhoods struggled in Ghana 
to access meaningful education during the lockdowns.
Stigma still exists for COVID-19. While there was very 
high knowledge of COVID-19, its signs and symptoms, 
both male (52%) and female (58%) respondents noted 
that they would be hesitant to interact with a person who 
had recovered from COVID-19. This highlights the stigma 
that the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders 
such as WHO have been campaigning against. This also 
meant that some people did not disclose their COVID-19 
status. However, male respondents (11%) said they knew 
people who were infected, with none of the women being 
aware of anyone infected with COVID-19 within their own 
community.
Loss of income has worsened food insecurity in poor 
urban areas. Most of the informal opportunities were 
affected by the lockdown and the general decline in 
business as people were spending less. The study area 
largely depended on informal employment which was 
negatively affected by the pandemic resulting in food 
insecurity. Food shortage had a gendered dimension, 
with women forgoing food consumption when there was 
a shortage, as compared to men. Domestic violence was 
noted by about 13% of the respondents to have gone up as 
a result of COVID-19, especially with the loss of economic 
opportunities.

Introduction
This research assessed the pressures, drivers and 
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Ghana in 
terms of gendered demand and consumption of water, 
and sanitation. The research was based on literature,  
a field questionnaire survey, Focus Group Discussions  
and Key Informant Interviews.
Pressures and Drivers for Water Demand 
and Consumption
Population increase is one of the main drivers for increased 
demand for water and sanitation services. The global 
population, projected to be 8.6 billion by 2030 and 
increase to 9.8 billion in 2050, had reached 7.6 billion 
people as of June 2017 (UN DESA 2017). Africa and Asia 
are experiencing rapid urbanization and it is one of the 
main challenges for providing adequate services in urban 
areas (Awumbila 2017). In Ghana, Awumbila et al. (2014) 
note that there is an interlinkage between migration, 
urbanization and poverty. The lack of proper infrastructure 
in some poorer neighborhoods is partly attributed to the 
rural-urban migration by the poor (Awumbila et al. 2014).
Urbanization has further compounded the population 
pressures, especially for urban areas such as Accra. 
Migration from rural areas and from the West Africa region 
has seen the population of Accra increasing. According 
to the Ghana Statistical Services (GSS), 50.9% of Ghana’s 
population now resides in urban areas. Most people in the 
colonial and postcolonial period perceived urban areas 
as offering greater economic opportunities and better 
infrastructure such as water and sanitation (GSS 2014). 
Ghana only uses about 1% of its freshwater resources, but 
pollution from illegal mining and agricultural activities is 
impacting its water resources (Yeleliere et al. 2018). Water 
scarcity could be attributed to economic or physical water 
scarcity (Molden 2007). While there is need to ensure 
water quality in Ghana, for now the main challenge is 
economic water scarcity, where financial resources are 
critical for providing adequate water and sanitation in 
Accra, and Ghana at large.
Gender in Water and Sanitation in 
COVID-19 Context: Why It Matters?
Global initiatives such as the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) — especially SDG 5 — addresses gender. 
The advent of COVID-19 has the potential of destroying 
some of the gender gains which had been made before 
the beginning of COVID-19. The focus of the study was 
the Ga South District, a rural district within the Greater 
Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA). Water and sanitation 
are genuine developmental concerns for Ghana, further 
magnified with the advent of COVID-19 (Connell 2020; 
Corburn et al. 2020; Duti 2020; Morgan 2020; Rutayisire et 
al. 2020; Saba 2020; UN Women 2020).
Ghana has acceded to international gender conventions, 
such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Since 
Independence there have been Constitutional policy 
pronouncements, legislation and strategies to address the 
gender imbalance. 
While there are progressive laws and policies in place, 
translating these into the lived experiences of the women 
remains a major challenge. An understanding of gender, 
especially access and control, from literature helped 
to inform the questions that were being asked in our 
questionnaire, qualitative group discussions and other 
data collected. The data collected was disaggregated 
according to sex, so the gender analysis could be 
conducted; as Doss notes, collecting sex disaggregated 
data is the first step towards collecting gender data 
(Doss 2013). When questions such as ‘why’ are asked, we 
begin to appreciate the importance of gender analysis 
as it underscores the reasons behind the unequal power 
dynamics between men and women.

Study Area 
The study was conducted in Ga South District which is 
part of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. It built on the 
Dutch Embassy funded urban study which helped develop 
the research instruments. These research instruments 
were further refined to accommodate the rural context 
and also added questions pertaining to domestic violence. 
The rationale for the selection of Ga South District was 
in-formed by it being a rural area in order to observe the 
impacts of COVID-19 within the rural context. The study 
was conducted in two adjacent communities, namely 
Obom and Obokwashie as shown in Figure 1.

Research Methodology
1 See Annex 1 for the questionnaire survey instrument that was used.
2 UNICEF: https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=2173
The research methodology entailed the use of a mixed 
methods approach (Castro et al. 2010; Creswell et al. 
2003; Galasiński and Kozłowska 2010; Morse et al. 2006; 
Plano Clark et al. 2008; Tashakkori and Teddlie 2010).  
Data collection was carried out in 2021, during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. First, a questionnaire survey was 
conducted among the 146 households. The questionnaire 
enumeration team comprised of four men and women 
each. The questionnaire was based on modules 
focussing on basic household information, household 
assets, knowledge of COVID-19, water and sanitation, 
handwashing, sources of income, food security and 
wellbeing.1 Most modules captured gender dimensions 
of the responses and collecting the pre-COVID-19 and 
COVID-19 era responses to better understand how the 
pandemic has differentially impacted the study community. 
One respondent (either male or female) was interviewed 
per household.
Second, 16 Focus Group Discussions were conducted 
with women, men, youths and mixed groups (refer to 
Table 1). These were led by a woman facilitator, who was 
supported by a man. The objective of the discussions was 
to ensure that the study validates the findings coming 
from the household questionnaire survey and also capture 
the differential interests among women, men and youths 
which were then moderated in the mixed group discussions 
to further validate the findings. Mixed groups were 
facilitated to discuss issues raised by the different groups 
and validation and cross learning. In line with COVID-19 
protocols, the maximum number of participants was 
six. For the mixed groups, these comprised of two adult 
women, two adult men and two youths. 
Third, 6 Key Informant Interviews were also conducted with 
district and other institutional researchers with knowledge 
of the study areas and water and sanitation issues. The key 
informants also included chiefs and district officials.

Fourth, in order to capture the lived experiences within 
the study area, 12 Life Histories were conducted. Life 
History respondents included women and men from 
different social strata and age groups as well as people 
living with disabilities. Life histories were meant to 
complement the Key Informant Interviews, which tend to 
focus on the institutional perspectives as opposed to the 
lived experiences of those bereft of senior positions in a 
community (Leahy 2021; Lokot 2021; Osella and Osella 
2000; Werner 2017). 
Literature review was conducted on COVID-19 journal and 
programme and project reports and websites. This was 
an important source of information and general trends. 
Webinars were also important for accessing up-to-date 
information on the rapidly unfolding pandemic. 
Ethics
Prior to beginning the field data collection, ethics forms were 
filled in for all the project components. The ethics forms also 
considered that the data collection was being conducted 
during the outbreak of COVID-19. Therefore, measures were 
put in place to ensure that both field enumerators and the 
household, as well as focus group respondents, followed 
the COVID-19 protocols recommended by the Government 
of Ghana and the World Health Organization. The ethics 
application was made to the IWMI Internal Review Board (IRB) 
who reviewed the submission. The IRB recommendations 
were diligently followed in the conduct of the study. All field 
enumerators and Focus Group Facilitators had to pass the 
UNICEF online course on Ethics.2
Limitations of the Study
The study did not include counterfactuals. The research 
team felt the insights from the questionnaire survey within 
the COVID-19 data collection restrictions to be important 
and relevant findings. The study also made use of insights 
from the Focus Group Discussions, which might not be 
statistically significant, but are significant for social science 
studies and need to be reflected in the report findings. For 
the medical waste management, the findings are based on 
Key Informant Interviews, and we believe that they reflect 
the issues affecting medical waste during the COVID-19 
era. The study could not conduct many Key Informant 
Interviews due to most institutions being partially closed.

Research Findings 
The following sections provide highlights from the research 
studies according to the different thematic topics.
Gender Composition of Respondents
The rural household survey interviewed 146 respondents 
comprising of 85 (58.2%) women and 61 (41.8%) men as 
shown in Table 2.
About 3 out of every 10 respondents (29.8%) were 
aged 26–35 years, followed by about one in every four 
respondents (25.9%) who were aged 18–25 years. The 
least proportion of respondents (7.8%) came from 
those who were aged above 60 years. The proportion 
of respondents from female-headed households 
were relatively higher than those from male-headed 
households headed by men among respondents aged 
26–35 years, 18–25 years, and above 60 years: 32.2%, 
27.1% and 11.9%, compared to 28.8%, 25.3%, and 6.2% 
respectively. For the 36–45 age group, the proportion 
of respondents from female-headed households 
comprised about 12%, with respondents from male-
headed households comprising nearly double the figure 
(about 22%) as shown in Figure 2.

Household Size Distribution by Gender
A greater proportion of households had about 4 to 5 
members (44.4%) followed by those with about 2 to 
3 members (31.2%). Both male- and female-headed 
households which were single-person households 
constituted about 8% of the sample. On the other hand, 
a higher proportion of the male-headed households 
(17.8%) had 6 to 9 members compared to female-headed 
households (11.9%) and 16.1% for the overall. This was 
different for urban areas where single-male respondents 
were 30% compared to 11% for women as shown in 
Figure 3. The study area is closer to Accra, hence a 
number of youths were likely to be migrating, mainly to 
Accra’s Dubai3 area. A better understanding of household 
composition has implications on water requirements and 
the burden for water collection.
About 44% of all households had a family size comprising 
4 to 5 family members.  
3 This is an area near the Kwame Nkrumah Interchange where most informal traders would migrate to. The name Dubai was first used by former 
President Mahama, when he inaugurated the interchange and declared that he had brought Dubai to Accra.

Respondents’ Marital Status
The monogamous married respondents were about 58% of 
the household questionnaire respondents. Polygamously 
married respondents comprised just above 1%, as shown 
in Figure 4. The proportion of the those who had never 
married was about 22% — about 34% for respondents 
in female-headed households and 17% for male-headed 
households. Widowed respondents made up 7% of the 
respondents with widows (women) comprising about 24% 
and widowers (men) below 1%. About 6% were living in 
informal consensual unions, and the divorced comprised 
about 3.4%. It is significant to note the nature of the 
marital status as it could determine access to resources 
and assets and how a household could respond to 
pandemics such as COVID-19 is key in this study.

Educational Level of Respondents
Education is a key attribute, basis gender as well as 
access to water and sanitation. More respondents from 
female-headed households, about 35.3%, had no formal 
education compared to about 13% of the respondents in 
male-headed households (see Table 3).
The study also accounted for the level of education that 
respondents had attained. Over half (52.6%) from female-
headed households had completed Junior Secondary 
School compared to a little over 40% of the respondents 
from male-headed households. The average for primary 
school level education was about 18.2%, with respondents 
from female-headed households making up about 10.5% 
and those from male-headed households comprising 
about 20.5% as shown in Figure 6.

Length of Stay in Study Area
The surveyed households had a wide range of length of 
stay. Most respondents had stayed for over 5 years in 
the study areas, with respondents from female-headed 
households having a slightly higher representation in the  
1 to 5 years category at about 31% as compared to 28% for 
those in male-headed households as shown in Figure 7.  
Key Informant Interviews with respondents such as the 
Chief indicated that there are also long-term residents; 
about 18% of the respondents have lived in the area for 
over 30 years, and were nearly evenly distributed between 
male- and female-headed households. The fact that this is 
a well-established resident population entails the need for 
further studies to try and better understand why the levels 
of access to water, and in particular sanitation, was low.

Knowledge of COVID-19
There was a high level of awareness of COVID-19 
symptoms among the respondents, especially with 
identifying coughing at 82% as the main symptom for 
both women and men as shown in Figure 8. The other 
symptoms identified by respondents included high body 
temperature (55.1%) and sneezing (41.0%). About 11% 
of respondents from male-headed households and 6.8% 
of the respondents from female-headed households 
indicated no knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms. This was 
more than three times greater than the number from the 
urban areas. The responses cited below from a woman 
and man who took part in the Focus Group Discussions 
highlight their awareness:
“…as for the disease, we have heard a whole lot about 
it, and we are told to always put on the nose mask. For 
me, whenever I am going to Accra is when I put on the 
mask. We also hear that it is killing a lot of people…” 
(Respondent 1, Female, Twi FGD, Women, Onibie).
“… COVID-19 is a disease that has come to this whole 
world that is transmitted from one person to another. It is 
airborne so once you get closer to an infected person you 
get it too. Dirt can also make you contract the disease…” 
(Respondent 2, Male, OBOM, Youth, FGD 1).

While the knowledge of COVID-19 was high among the 
respondents, there was also the perception that it was 
more so affecting urban areas (such as Accra). The women 
respondent cited above says: “…for me, whenever I am 
going to Accra is when I put on the mask.” The responses 
on the perception towards nose mask wearing were 
similar for both women and men. This further aligns with 
global research findings (Howard 2021).
One respondent explained that they put on a mask when 
they go out and not at home because there is no COVID-19 
in their households.
The youths were noted to have better access to 
information on COVID-19. However, discussions with the 
Youth Focus Group Discussions it was pointed out that 
that knowledge is further disaggregated, with boys having 
greater information access than girls.
“… we boys usually do a lot of outing than the grownups 
and we are the ones that usually use android phones so all 
the time we see updates…” (Respondent 3, Male, Obom, 
Youth FGD, 1).
“…okay, the boys are into ‘Okada;’ business (motor-riding 
business) so it’s understandable more boys can afford 
smart phones. As for we, the ladies, if we don’t work, we 
cannot afford smart phones…” (Respondent 4, Female, 
Obokwashie, Youth).
Nuanced and differential access to information was 
reported to be a factor of the gender roles in domestic 
and reproductive labor. The quotations from women and 
youth Focus Group Discussions highlight such information 
asymmetry.
“… from my point of view, some men wake up and 
leave the house to go to town leaving the women at 
home working. So, when information comes since he 
is outside, he would hear it first and later inform you 
when he gets home.” (Respondent 5, Female, Obom, 
FGD, Women 2).
IWMI - 9
Working Paper 213 - Gender in Water and Sanitation Provision and Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Ghana  
“…like they said men usually chat among themselves, but 
women hardly do that. We women are always busy at home 
working so I would not have the time to call a friend to chat 
with…” (Respondent 6, Female, Obom, Youth, FGD 1).
Few people (3.4%) knew someone who had contracted 
COVID-19. Of this, those from male-headed households 
were 2.1%, with respondents from female-headed 
households comprising 6.8% as shown in Figure 9.
Notably, there was stigma against those who had 
contracted COVID-19. About two-thirds of the 
respondents from male-headed households indicated 
that they would stay away from a person who had 
recovered from COVID-19 as compared to about half of 
those from female-headed households. The proportion 
of respondents from female-headed households who 
would stay away from people who have recovered from 
the disease was 10 percentage points lower than that of 
those from male-headed households. Nevertheless, the 
majority of the respondents stigmatize persons infected 
with COVID-19. This could also contribute to most 
patients not informing their neighbors once they know 
they have contracted COVID-19.

Domestic Violence
The study sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 
on domestic violence. Table 4 lists the results from the 
questionnaire survey. About 13% of the respondents felt 
that COVID-19 was contributing to domestic violence.
The questionnaire survey offered potential reasons 
for the increased domestic violence. Men identified 
family altercations as a result of financial hardship 
and verbal abuse between husband and wife as the 
main forms of domestic abuse. Women, on the other 
hand, identified general emotional and physical 
abuse, at 50% and financial altercations due to 
financial hardship at about 33% as the main two 
highest forms of domestic violence. Table 5 shows 
some more forms of domestic violence identified by 
respondents.

Gendered COVID-19 Impacts
This section illustrates a few highlights of the gendered 
impacts of COVID-19.
Impact on women and men
The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
women manifested through the loss of income (35.1%), 
decline in business / trading activities (32.8%), 
restrictions in movement / general human activities 
(14.9%) and loss of jobs (14.2%), whereas job losses 
(37.3%), loss of income (31%) and decline in business 
activities (15.9%) were the main impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on men (see Figures 10 and 11). 
Loss of income (39.6%) among women in male-headed 
households coupled with decline in business activities 
(31.3%) were the main effects of COVID-19 on women. 
Decline in business activities (36.8%), loss of income 
(23.7%) and loss of jobs (21.1%) were cited as the main 
effects of COVID-19 on women among female-headed 
households (see Figure 10).

The main adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
men included loss of job (37.3%), loss of income (31%), 
and decline in business activities (15.9%). Men in male-
headed households were the most affected as 38.5% and 
35.2% cited loss of employment and loss of income from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the men in female-headed 
households, 34.3% lost their jobs and 20% recorded loss 
of income (see Figure 11).

Working Paper 213 - Gender in Water and Sanitation Provision and Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Ghana  
Teenage pregnancies
School-going children were affected by school closure. 
Significantly, about 10% of the girls were further disrupted 
due to teenage pregnancies. It was interesting to note that 
teenage pregnancies were more pronounced in female-
headed households at about 21% compared to male-
headed households where the rate was 5%. This further 
reinforces the importance of using a gender lens when 
providing solutions to the gendered and intersectional 
impact of COVID-19.

COVID-19 and Impact on Study Area
It was very clear from both the quantitative and 
qualitative research findings that COVID-19 had negative 
consequences in the communities. The respondents 
reported that COVID-19 drastically reduced employment 
opportunities but also noted that it had brought a few 
opportunities according to about 16% of the male 
respondents and 10% of the female respondents. A few 
people noted that they have started producing and selling 
face masks and other protective equipment (Figure 12).

Measures Taken for Protection Against 
COVID-19
The respondents articulated the main measures to 
be taken to protect themselves from the spread of 
COVID-19. The response measures included the use of 
nose mask when going out (85.9%), frequent washing 
of hands (76.1%), use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers 
in the absence of handwashing (68.8%) and practicing 
social distancing (46.8%) among others. A few of 
the respondents (2%) noted a lack of knowledge on 
preventative measures against COVID-19 (see Figure 13).
One of the possible reasons for the high level of knowledge 
was due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, which 
affected all communities. The Government of Ghana, the 
World Health Organization, UNICEF, the European Union 
and other development partners embarked on campaigns 
over the radio, televisions, community meetings, mobile 
loudspeaker announcements and billboards, which makes 
it difficult to understand the cases where respondents 
indicated that they had no knowledge. Significant 
resources were availed for publicity campaigns and 
warnings pertaining to COVID-19.
Geography of the COVID-19 Victims
Figure 14 shows the geography of persons infected with 
COVID-19 that the respondents knew about. Among the 
3.4% who knew someone who has contracted COVID-19, 
about 14.3% of them said they were located in the same 
community, 28.3% identified them in a neighboring 
community within the same district, while 42% noted they 
were located elsewhere in Ghana and 14.3% observed 
that they were located in a different district but same 
region. All those who knew people in their communities of 
residence who had contracted the disease or in a different 
district but same region were respondents in female-
headed households. Two-thirds of the respondents 
in male-headed households indicated they knew of 
COVID-19 cases in other parts of Ghana but not within 
Greater Accra. This is an interesting finding as it was also 
an argument used for not observing the lockdown when 
it was imposed on Accra and Kumasi. Most of the low-
income households who wanted to engage in the informal 
sector were calling for the lifting of the lockdown as they 
knew no one in their communities that had been affected.

Domestic Water Access for Surveyed 
Households
The surveyed respondents were collectively mainly 
accessing water through boreholes or tube wells (31.2%), 
with 23.7% of female-headed households recording this 
water source against 34.2% for male-headed households. 
The public standpipe was the second most used source of 
water at about 21%. As opposed to urban settings, rural 
areas do not have water connections to the house or the 
compound. 
It is important to note that the Government of Ghana’s 
Free Water Initiative largely catered to urban areas 
where the Ghana Water Company provides piped water 
which were complemented with water tankers during the 
initiative. Rural areas never benefited from the same as 
they continued to pay for water which is based on the size 
of container used to collect water. This water fee is meant 
to ensure that there is a fund for maintenance and to pay 
the person responsible for collecting the water levy and 
guaranteeing that the water point is clean. Some boreholes 
open at certain times and will be locked during non-
operational hours. A number of respondents confirmed 
that the free water initiative had not been extended to the 
rural areas:
“There is no free water in the community, when COVID-19 
came that they were supplying free water it didn’t reach 
here, we all bought water before and after COVID-19…” 
(Respondent 7, Female, Obom, FGD, Women 1).
“Since the start of the COVID-19, and they said they were 
given water, we never had some of the water. Moderator: 
Very good. They said they were sharing food, we did not 
get anything and at last, the food that came that we did 
not even know where it came from, were in takeaways and 
they even made politics out the food that was brought to 
this Obom community…” (Respondent 8, Male, 2nd Mixed 
Group, Obom).
Access to Drinking Water
About 42% of the questionnaire survey respondents 
bought plastic water sachets for drinking, followed by 
those who fetched their drinking water from a borehole 
or a tube well (31.2%) and public tap / standpipe (21%) 
as shown in Figure 15. A higher proportion of female-
headed respondents (47.5%) used sachet water as 
their main source of drinking water compared to 39% 
of the male-headed households. In spite of the plastic 
sachets being more affordable than bottled water, 
it still negatively affects the access of low-income 
earners to safe drinking water. This was not anticipated, 
especially in the context of rural areas, where financial 
resources tend to be limited compared to urban areas. 
Studies conducted on sachet drinking water samples 
demonstrate that even this packaged water is less 
regulated, resulting in a wide variation of the sachet 
water quality (Wright et al. 2004). Some of the sachet 
water companies use tap water with minimum further 
purification (Kangmennaang et al. 2020; Machdar et al. 
2013; Wright et al. 2004).

Source of Water for Handwashing during 
COVID-19 
For the residents, water for handwashing in the pre-
COVID-19 period was mainly obtained from elsewhere 
(94.6%), other than in their own dwelling (3.9%) or in 
their own yard or plot (1.5%) as shown in Figure 16.

Figure 17 illustrates the main sources of water for 
handwashing during COVID-19. It was observed that both 
female- and male-headed households largely depended 
on borehole water (55.9% and 58.9% respectively) 
and public standpipe (32.2% and 34.9% respectively) 
for handwashing during the pandemic. The remaining 
sources each contributed smaller proportions of water

Who Collects Water?
The aggregated results show that mostly women and girls 
tend to collect water for household use (Figure 18). Further 
disaggregation of the results based on the gender of the 
household heads highlight an interesting finding. From 
male-headed households, a higher proportion of women 
collected water for the household than girls while female-
headed households reported a higher proportion of girls 
collecting water for household use than women; 53%, 
33.3%, 51.7% and 44.8%, respectively. 
These findings reflect that water collection in the rural 
context is still gendered with the responsibility for water 
collection largely shouldered by women and girls. It is 
important to also note that men said it was a taboo for 
men to carry water. The advent of COVID-19 entails the 
need to collect more water for increased handwashing, 
cleaning and other hygiene purposes.
Domestic water collection was largely characterized as 
the role of women, indicating that women had a greater 
burden as compared to urban settings, to go out and 
collect water. Focus Group Discussions further revealed 
the gendered nature of domestic water collection.
“… To answer you, in this community there are some tasks 
we consider the responsibility of the woman and others we 
feel is for men. And you know also that we use firewood 
a lot here; so, the boys go to the bush to collect firewood 
and then girls go for water collection. So, the woman’s 
responsibility is to bring water and the boys’ responsibility 
is to bring firewood…” (Respondent 9, Male, Obokwashie, 
FGD, Mixed 1).
“…what I can also add is that, is our fathers and brothers 
work hard to get food on the table so we cannot allow 
them fetch water after their hard work. The house duties 
are for the females whiles the males brings housekeeping 
money. So how you treat your brother depends on how 
you would treat your husband in future…” (Respondent 10, 
Female, Obokwashie, FGD, Female Youth 1).
“It is the same; most of the time it is the young girls that 
cooks at home so the same reason why we allow women 
to fetch water applies to the girls too. Again, you cannot 
go to the water source with an elderly man as a young man 
and fetch your water first before the man, it doesn’t show 
respect. You have to even take his container and fetch the 
water for him before you have your turn.” (Respondent 11, 
Male, Obom, FGD, Youth 1).

Duration of Water Collection
Over half of the households included in the survey 
obtained water from sources that took them at 
most 10 minutes to fetch and return home. Over a 
quarter of the households spent about 2–5 minutes 
to fetch water and return home, and another one-
fourth reported spending about 6–10 minutes. Water 
collection times were 2–5 minutes for about 37% of the 
female-headed household compared to 25% for the 
male-headed households as shown in Figure 19. About 
29% of female-headed households took 11–20 minutes

to collect water, similar to about 27% for the male-
headed households. About 17% of the female-headed 
households needed 21–65 minutes to collect water 
which compares with male-headed households (about 
19%). It is important to note that only one additional 
borehole was provided after the advent of COVID-19. 
So, the actual water collection time for the community 
largely remained the same, before and during the 
COVID-19 period. What changed, however, was the 
frequency of collecting water as more water was used 
due to the need to practice increased handwashing and 
general cleanliness.

Access to Sanitation
This section provides a brief overview of the findings on the 
sanitation facilities that household members had access to 
within the study communities.
Type of toilet facility used by household 
members 
Access to sanitation was a major challenge in the study 
area. Generally, about 4 out of every 10 households did 
not have toilet facility in their households. About 42% 
of the male-headed households had no toilet facilities, 
higher than female-headed households (about 32%). 
They were using the bush or open areas. About 37% of the 
female-headed households were using pit latrine with slab 
compared to 32% of the male-headed households as in 
Figure 20. 
Field observations showed that most households did not 
have such pit and slab toilets at their homestead. These 
were public toilets as well as schools and health facility 
toilets which the communities had taken over. The school 
had managed to build new toilets to avoid pupils using 
the same toilet facilities with the public. The hospital 
was also in the process of fundraising in order to provide 
toilets with patients-only access. Respondents noted the 
following:
“…yes, even when they built a toilet for the school then, 
the community members use it and don’t keep it neat. 
Even three days ago it was announced that the community 
members also defecate in classrooms. They have 
announced it several times, but they still use the school 
toilet. I have toilet in my house. As a result, there a lot of 
polythene bags (take away) in the town. I also have toilet 
in my house, I don’t use public toilet.” (Respondent 12, 
Female, Obom, FGD, Women 2).
“…you see because of the smell you do that in the house 
but rather in the bush but now there are chemicals that 
they pour in those holes, so the smell is minimized but we 
don’t have the money to build toilet facility…” (Respondent 
13, Female, Obokwashie, FGD, Women 1).
The issue of access to sanitation did not change with 
COVID-19. In order to clean the public as well as the 
hospital and school toilets which had been ‘taken over’ 
by the community, a volunteer was collecting fees. An 
interview with toilet fee collector and cleaner revealed that 
there is no fixed fees to use the toilet. Fees for toilet use 
range from GHS 0.10 to GHS 0.50. The toilet fee collector, 
however, lamented that most people do not want to 
pay and end up going into the bush to defecate. Women 
during FGDs indicated that going to the bush was quite 
risk (especially at night); women and children had even 
resorted to using plastic bags which would be disposed of 
in the bush during daytime. Societal views on sanitation 
were also raised during FGDs and interviews, as it was 
noted that surprisingly, even households with very modern 
housing structures did not have toilet facilities. The taboos 
resonate with studies elsewhere within Ghana and even 
more broadly, within West Africa (Balasubramanya et al. 
2021; WaterAid 2009).

COVID-19 and Food Security
In the past 12 months, COVID-19 has impacted food 
security. About 6 out of every 10 households skipped or 
reduced the quantity of meals served in the household. 
Less than 7% of the respondents skipped or reduced 
the size of meals almost always or all the time. For the 
households that skipped some of the meals some of the 
time, female-headed households were at about 46% with 
male-headed households at about 40% as shown in  
Figure 21.

The study went further to ask which household member 
would be affected by the reduced or skipped meal due to 
food shortages; the results are presented in Figure 22.  
Most household heads were the worst hit when the 
household had to reduce or skip meals. This was very 
prevalent among female-household heads as two-thirds 
of them had to forgo their meals or reduce the size, 
compared to 43.9% of the male-household heads.

Financial Coping Mechanisms
Loans were one of the instruments for coping with financial 
stress. On average, female-headed households borrowed 
CHS 945, much lower than male-headed households 
where the average amount borrowed stood at CHS 2,350 
— nearly two and half times greater. As for the sources of 
loans, women solely borrowed from susu groups (42.9%), 
family (28.6%) and cooperatives (28.6%) as shown in 
Figure 23. It was interesting that even savings clubs (susu) 
which are usually led by women, the proportion of male-
headed households that borrowed from this source was 
slightly higher than female-headed households; 46.2% 
and 42.9% respectively. Male-headed households were 
the only ones that accessed commercial and microfinance 
loans as well as loans from other sources.
Receipt of Remittance from Household 
Member during COVID-19
Over half of the female-headed households (50.8%) 
respondents received remittances compared to less 
than 16% of the male-headed households (Figure 24). 
While the percentage of households receiving 
remittances were similar in the pre- and post-COVID-19 
periods, most respondents noted that the amount 
had been largely reduced as a result of low economic 
activities experienced by both local and international 
migrants.

Working Paper 213 - Gender in Water and Sanitation Provision and Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rural Ghana 
Discussion
This report has briefly introduced the pressures and 
drivers for water and sanitation services in the rural Ga 
South District. 
The lived experiences of COVID-19 are markedly different 
for men and women. COVID-19 further exacerbated 
women’s triple burden of reproductive, productive and 
community roles (Zibani 2016). Domestic violence was 
reported to have increased partly due to the confinement 
in smaller spaces, especially for the study community. 
A joint review by GSS and UNDP also showed that areas 
where lockdown had been enforced saw a 7% increase 
in domestic violence cases (GSS and UNDP 2020). The 
economic hardships as a result of the lockdown were cited 
as some of the contributing reasons in the rural study 
area. Most of the responses and COVID-19 state responses 
did not take such social and gender dimensions into 
account. It is therefore important that future responses 
to health emergencies such as COVID-19 and other global 
crises consider their differential impact on gender.
COVID-19 had repercussions on informal employment 
opportunities, with a differential impact for women and 
men. The Ghana Statistical Services in partnership with 
the United Nations Development Programme (GSS and 
UNDP 2020) noted that COVID-19 had an overall negative 
impact on business and employment opportunities. The 
government’s free water was a noble but incomplete 
initiative, and did not benefit rural households which 
are not provided water by the Ghana Water Company 
(Amankwaa and Ampratwum 2020). Women and girls’ 
water collection burden has been worsened, because 
more water was required to prevent COVID-19. Most 
women and girls were collecting water outside their 
homestead while also being increasingly responsible 
for childcare and other reproductive, productive and 
community responsibilities. COVID-19 stigma was 
prevalent with the majority of women and men not willing 
to get close to a person who would have recovered from 
the disease. The stigma might also have contributed 
to respondents hardly knowing anyone within their 
neighborhood who had been affected by COVID-19. It is 
therefore important that policy responses to crises such 
as COVID-19 are designed to be inclusive of gender and 
the accompanying differential power dynamics. There is 
also a need to better understand stigmas around health 
emergencies as they might undermine the data and scale 
of the impact of diseases such as COVID-19.
The loss of income has worsened food insecurity in the 
study area. Cities which are markets for agricultural 
produce, and went through lockdown, saw an about 
84% decline in sales and a 74% decline in production. 
This had a knock-on effect on the informal as well as the 
agricultural sector. Women were slightly more impacted 
in terms of food assistance requirement. Women were 
also more likely to miss a meal as a result of the resultant 
food shortage due to COVID-19. The joint GSS and UNDP 
review of the COVID-19 impact in Ghana also noted that 
different arms of the government and local authorities 
received assistance to help cope with COVID-19 (GSS and 
UNDP 2020). The most common type of assistance in the 
lockdown districts was both cooked and uncooked food. 
Such efforts, however, were largely concentrated in urban 
areas; rural areas missed out on the food assistance. 
This will most likely have negative nutrition outcomes, 
especially with the research findings that women were 
more likely to miss a meal during food shortage. Shocks 
such as COVID-19 may worsen the gap between men 
and women (Ragasa and Lambrecht 2020). This therefor 
calls for deploying a robust gender lens towards social 
protection measures (Corburn et al. 2020; Hujo 2021; 
Leigh 2020; Méndez et al. 2020).
COVID-19 has negatively affected youth due to loss of 
employment as well as disruptions in studies. Youths who 
were working in the informal sector lost their employment 
opportunities. Those who were still going to school were 
also negatively affected as virtual learning required 
internet connectivity which was prevalent in most of the 
rural communities. Some education lessons were being 
offered through television, again not accessible to the 
majority in the study community. While Africa has often 
been touted as having a population dividend through its 
youth population, the dividend may only be achieved 
through rigorous planning which accounts for the youth 
(Aphunu and Atoma 2010; Fox et al. 2020; Heckert et al. 
2020; Mueller and Thurlow 2019; Sumberg 2021).
Access to sanitation, which was not impacted by 
COVID-19, is a major concern for the study community. 
Most households had no access to a household toilet 
facility and were using the bush, or sometimes public 
facilities if they could afford them. Despite a new public 
facility close to completion, most of the people were 
using the bush or open pits which dug in the bush. This 
raises questions (Keraita et al. 2013; WaterAid 2009) on 
how perceptions and practices and use of toilets could be 
changed over time. It is important that responses to such 
infrastructural challenges consider the differential gender 
dimensions as well as further compounded health risks 
that are posed.

Conclusion
This social and economic study has endeavored to 
better understand the status of access to water and 
sanitation in Ga South District in the pre- and COVID-19 
periods. The study area was selected as a rural 
community. The findings highlight the importance of 
better understanding the gendered and differential 
access to water and sanitation facilities in Ga South 
within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. The 
study further highlights the importance of a nuanced 
and gendered understanding of water and sanitation 
interventions, including the Free Water Initiative which 
seem less well-targeted by neglecting the poorer 
women and men in the rural areas. The findings call 
for responses to COVID-19 such as social protection 
measures, to take into account the differential impact 
on women, men, youths and other vulnerable people. 
This means that the responses have to be tailored to 
the varying and intersectional circumstances of the 
community members. COVID-19, in the study area, as 
also seen elsewhere, clearly points to the importance 
of social inclusion to ensure that infrastructure such 
as water and sanitation needs to be provided to all 
citizens. The research believes that this can offer a new 
trajectory for development in Ghana and beyond.
